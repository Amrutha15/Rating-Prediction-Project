1610,5,"I was in confusion before order, when I received my lappy really loved it. Asus should we go this, yes of course in this process segment fingerprint unlock, compact design, backlit keyboard and superb display etc.. I really like my asus app for getting my laptop updated and healthy. Fast Charging is available. Battery i have not checked but fine decent packaging fast delivery thanks flipkart."
1611,5,After using 15 days I would say product is good to buy. 1. Sleek design. 2. Light weight. 3. Good battery backup. 4. Good performance according to configuration. 5. Sound and display is average. However my experience with flipkart is horrible but rating is given here to product - Asus Vivobook X413JA. I found it value for money and would suggest to go for it.
1612,4,Best compact laptop but build quality is not metalic! Battery backup is good sound quality is descent and display is very bright 250nits
1613,4,Excellent performance 1.nvme m.2 ssd blazing speed 2. Light weight 3. Compact design 4. Touch pad and finger lock feel like mobile touch and many features include 5. Decent battery backup
1614,5,"It is as I expected. Light, sleek, compact and decent quality. I really like its white colour glossy finish. I recieved this on 8.03.2021 in 36240 rupees. And I think in this price range no product exist today. And its specs are awesome."
1615,5,Worth purchase for students and who have just lite work .Everything is top notch except the battery I can't say its worst but it is less then the other laptops which are available in this price segment.
1616,4,This is nice laptop and performance are very smooth and looking is very pretty this is a light laptop and i got this in diwali sell and price this laptop 32737 and battery backup around 4to5 hour This review after 8 days
1617,4,"The laptop is thin and handy.. due to SSD booting speed is around 6 seconds. The ms office key is not included. Processor fan is close to display ,so you will feel warm . Backlit keyboard is advantage. I dont see in any other model under 38k.  Brought it for 33250 including bank offer and serve the purpose.  If you look for a stylish ,handy and daily use laptop..go for it . !!"
1618,5,"After one month of use ASUS VIVOBOOK 14/15 i3 core laptop value of money and good performance. In this laptop there is baklit keyboard, which gives good typing experience in night and a finger prit reader for the security. There is 14"" antiglare display and tracked is also good and fast.

1619,4,"Camera quality of this laptop is very bad. It is like 1990's camera with lot of bubbles. Even the a 5K mobile will have better camera. If you are planning to use this for video calls as a presenter, then this is not the choice.  Also the customer support is very bad, not able to connect with them through call or chat properly.  Apart from this all other features are good"

Now coming to your main concern, is 4gb ram enough? 1st, yes! It is enough, if you are not editing videos or playing games ( it's not a gaming laptop tbh) 2nd, you can increase the ram upto 12 gb...."

I was searching a laptop which is good enough for all the parameters light weight, fast, good design, decent memory. As I am not a heavy user. For my type of persons it will be best & it is unbeatable. Because 1TB HDD can not beat 512 GB SSD & SSD is very fast as compared to HDD. Laptop boots in just 7-8 Seconds. Best feature is fingerprint sensor. It is ..."
1624,5,"Best laptop for students and working professionals. Finger print sensor is just awesome. Decent battery life. If you are looking for a laptop for regular office works or if you are a student, then you can go for it. But, I've not played heavy games yet."

Surprisingly super fast fingerprint sensor Cons = 1. This type of blue color. I personally like blue color, but not this cobalt blue. Peacock blue is more attractive than this. I recommend black color of this model. 2. Microsoft word /excel not included, only 15 days trial pack included. This is disgusting. 3. This model comes with h..."

1629,3,I ordered the cream color version but got the black one...(one star less for that) **Battery backup is averege **Display is awesome considering the price **Sound output is really good **I assumed it a bit faster in processing before purchasing it(my personal experience) **Built quality could have been better **Have some handy features (one can insert sd card without card reader and so on.....) Overall its a balanced Laptop for students and I got it at 36890
1630,5,"I have got this for my wife and its perfect for her light usage.  1. i3 10th gen is around 6% slower than i5 8th gen. 2. nvme m2 sdd is an plus. 3. small, sleek light, just like a notebook it can fit in your bag. 4. Harman Kardon (:D) okay, this branding is good for satisfaction. You will not find any much difference when compared with sonicmaster. 5. silent machine. 6. that yellow return key is an added advantage (you know, Girls :p, that is what her colleagues noticed first)  People demotiv..."

1632,5,"The laptop is very handy and light weight. I have used it for around 10 days and it is working perfectly fine. The battery is not that good, when I have used it for online class and switched on the video, in full charge it gave back up of 2 hour only, whereas if we use it normaly for typing watching movie or pdf reading the back up was about 3:30 hr. Overall I am having good experience with the laptop."
1633,4,I have got this few hours back. The packing was awesome. These features and price is juz a fab combo.the nly thing is u can't upgrade ram. This is perfect for basic users like me. I mean for small programmings n codings. This is not a gaming laptop. This is perfect for average and below average users.
1634,5,I can tell u exactly that it is the best laptop under 40k . It has all the features a nrml laptop should have. Amazing design and display. Loud and clear sound. Powerful system with no lag. Good battery and charging. Well suited best for me bcz i do online classes and got it with offers in 37k.
1635,5,Products is very awesome in this price. But battery running time is approx 4-5 hours display is also good . Flipkart deliver this product is delay 2 day after promise date is 18 day . flipkart is very poor delivery service so not buy any product very important and fast needed on flipkart
1636,4,"The laptop features a core i3 processor with 4GB RAM that handles the tasks quite swiftly. Overall a good buy.  Pros: 1. Handy 2. Lightweight and portable 3. Good build quality 4. Good performance in the budget range 5. Good battery life (around 5 to 6 hours)  Cons: 1. Display (although it claims to be an IPS panel, the viewing angles are not good and the display looks pale) 2.

1637,3,1) Display is ok. Viewing angles are not too good not too bad. Under 40k it is good.  2) Battery is not good. Don't expect it to last more then 3 hrs. Charging takes almost 3 hrs from 15 %.  3) Performance is good. Ssd is too good. Boot up timing is less then 7 sec. Performance is also good for normal day to day usage.  4) Camera is ok . Under good light it is better then the rest under 40 k  5) Sound is not loud enough. But the quality is good.the tuning is good.  6) Build quality is good...

1644,4,"This is laptop for People who looks for elegant design, great disay and for normal usage like browsing, excel & two apps in background. It's good for students and people who begins to work in laptop. The performance is good enough and battery backup is good to last for 5 to 6 hours based on usage. You won't get Microsoft 365 access which is to be noted. I liked it for the display, design and some features like backlit keyboard & fingerprint scanner in this price segment."

In short, this is a superb laptop at such low price and students/professionals can definitely buy this if they don't require heavy memory/graphic usage.

1706,1,After Using of 1year it showing automatically battery drainage and it restart automatically.  Very Unhappy with this product.
1707,1,The laptop looks and performance is fine. But i am not happy with the touchpad. The curser pointer jump and flicker unnecessary. Which happen after few days of use. By now i hv lot of database and i hv lot of project to finish. I dont how to rectify the problem without hampering my job. This review is the ext of earlier review after 3 month of use. The touchpad is not responding. Curser is not moving. Very bad exp with asus vivo.
1708,4,"Laptop is overall good . But one thing you need to know RAM is only 4gb which is soldered that means we can't upgrade it. Ram management is somehow poor. Yet this lappy is eligible for windows 11 but trust me you can't use windows 11 in it , it crashes all the time.  So better go for other model or with higher ram.   Pros: value for money Premium look and feel I3 , 10th gen is good 512gb ssd Fingerprint reader ( its most amazing feature) Due to ssd booting time is awesome Battery backup is ..."
1709,5,Awesome Laptop for Business Presentations and Meetings
1710,5,"Awesome product, i totally loved it. Value for money"
1711,2,Bought this laptop recently. Initially it was good. I used only for checking emails and my son's online class. Suddenly few times the mouse cursor would disappear. Mouse wouldn't work only. Then I had to attach a external mouse and it works. After showing it to service guy checking if mouse pad is disabled or something. But figured out everything was intact. It happened couple of time I noticed this happens if I keep it in sleep for 4 or 5 hours or more keeping files and applications open. ...
1712,4,"I am giving this honest review after using the Asus vivobook laptop for 1 month. Sound quality is better Battery work maximum 5hour or minimum 4 hours Full HD anti glare display Web camera is 720 slightly photo quality is good not best. Due to SSD it is very fast, take only 5 second to start I am purchased this laptop from this Flipkart RS 38990. It is is something costly for me. Packing is good. I hope the service of this Asus laptop will be better Because I have not experience any services ..."

Sound quality is good

As per price product is decent in respect of other brand specially redmi, oppo, Vivo. 1. 90 Hz refresh rate gives smoothness(no brand gives in this price range) 2.

Initially, the caller's complaint of echo in the voice calling but sorted out after help from the Motorola service centre. 3. Camera quality is average (The rear camera is somewhat ok but the front camera is not up to the mark). 4. Speakers are sufficiently loud so that you can enjoy your videos. 5.

2969,5,"Given the price point of this phone, moto has done a great job in making this phone. This is a wonderful phone for the given price point. If you compare it with phones in the higher price segment (i.e. 15 - 20K) then for sure you will notice difference hence if you are on a budget then this is a very good phone for a budget buyer."
2970,5,Nice product 😍 I loved it . After using 4 month my experience is pretty good . I like the battery the most . Camera is awesome. Sound is blockbuster.
2971,5,"Really nice Mobile by Motorola, superb look great battery life with triple camera set up. I love to go with my MOTO 🤗 Thank you Motorola & Flipkart🙏 I am really happy 😊"
2972,5,"I complete 6 month with this Device....😄 It's it's it's just Superb ....  Really value for money product.👌 Any one really want a good quality budget smart device under 10k,then blindly choose it (motorolla e40)👍  In 10k budget range large of phone available in market.. But Don't forget Moto Is a Brand one ..No one give this type of processor like Moto.. (G70, G80 - G85 processor give under 14k price range) but moto give as far as better processor in 10k. 👍  No lag , awesome battery backup..."
2973,4,Overall best in class with affordable price but if you are a selfie lover then don't buy this phone! And the network connectivity is also not so good. The performance of the phone is best in this price segment.
2974,1,Phone looks good but has many cons. Charging is super slow......  The camera is below average not upto the mark.  Only good thing is it has a near stock android UI.  Suggest Not to Buy.
2975,4,"Bought this phone for my mom. Writing this review after 3days of usage. Overall this is a great value for money product. The camera works good in outdoor or in good lighting conditions but same cannot be said for low lighting. Just because it has more mega pixels means you'll get a great camera.. coming to display the 90hz screen is smooth, by default it's on auto you can change it in settings. The ips display is good not that bright though... Only when u keep the brightness to max it get br..."

2990,3,"Only One week of usage, So far so good. For people who want to keep things simple with stock android OS, and with no other Hungama. And in this price range its sure that there will be some issues here and there, but nothing critical to cease the usual flow of the phone usage. Battery is definitely a big plus, camera is average, overall for this price it's a pretty decent phone."

3262,5,I got my product after 10 days from my ordered date but never mind finally i received my iphone 12 its crazyyyyy Trust me if you wanna have any handy Handset and high performance within your budget then you can go for this Its truly Unbeatable
3263,1,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating. I don’t know if the problem is only with my device or its general,..."
3264,5,"After being a long time samsung user i switched to iphone again after iphone 4s and i am thoroughly enjoying it. Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch. Icing on the cake apple car play is much more usable than android auto😬😬"
3265,5,So far so good. It’s my dream to own an iPhone for over a decade. Finally came true with iPhone 12. Previously owned Samsung S9 plus so competing with android i will say my likes and dislikes.  Likes: 1. OS is really fluid 2. Security features like facial recognition for app installation etc 3. Little nuances like ringtone sound reduction automatically after I see the mobile 4. Camera is good though still equal to Samsung can’t say extraordinary 5. Facial unlock is really quick 6. 5G ready s...
3266,5,"What a amazing phone ! I bought this amazing beast for my soul mate & she’s very happy and blissful. Wonderful camera , beautiful design must buy worth every penny"
3267,5,"First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."
3268,5,"Switched from Android to iOS and won’t regret a bit. This one of the best devices have used in a while.  Pros:  1. Performance is super snappy, no lags whatsoever. 2. Battery performance is pretty good too. M not a heavy user so currently charging it once every two days. 3. Haven’t used camera much but pretty sure it’s splendid too. 4. Size is spot on, neither too big nor too small. Very easy to use in one hand. 5. Display is good too. One note though, for those feeling display is too w..."
3269,5,Awesome Camera
3270,5,Camera quality is just fabulous. Interface is very smooth. Good for photography and videography.
3271,5,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.  1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far 2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use 3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X  Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.  Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"
3272,5,"Thanx flipkart for value super sale for short time period of 1hour😁, flipkart might need to work on faster delivery Iphone 12 which i got in best price on flipkart 1. Camera performance - superb 2. Display - superb 3. Interface - Amazing"
3273,5,Best camera and great battery backup low light picks are awesome and best aperture 1.7 And the pics from Night come out great. best value for money 🤟🏻👌🏻
3274,5,"I got my I phone 12 in just 2 days of order, Thanks flipkart for delivering it faster.  Pros: Super faster than previous version Display is amazing Speaker is absolutely perfect. It gives very classic premium looks.  Cons: Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra. Cost is very high. Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."
3275,5,"It's my first iphone ever n i brought it with all my earned money✌✌ The best is yet to come n i am really happy with the product was delivered on time by flipkart Overall it's light weighted, awesome camera quality n i love the purple color 😍🥰 so it's a dream come to true finally have a iphone ✌💯"
3276,5,Product is very fantastic i am just love it. Display is awesome. Performance like buttery smooth. Iam android user before 6year but never experience like this performance. You can definitely go for this. Due to late delivery i give only three star.
3277,4,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
3278,5,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
3279,5,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
3280,5,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

3282,4,I am first time use iphone very fast performance battery backup to good iphone unic features copy paste double tap screen shot extra very help ful camera low light very good but camera manual mode missing no hug but some time get bugs crome browser totally 9/10 thanks to apple 🍏
3283,5,"Top class performance and battery backup too. Charges quickly if u are using a 20w charger. Night mode is good , HDR mode works flawlessly. VFM phone."
3284,5,Best in every department. ❤️ I upgraded on iPhone from Samsung S20plus and after use almost 10 days I realise that it’s my good decision.
3285,5,"My 1st iPhone ever and I’m loving it. Great performance, awesome display, camera is outstanding which comes with heavily priced. But worth it. White color looks super cool. 🎉😊😍"
3286,5,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone. Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
3287,3,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks. Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
3288,5,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.  I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
3289,4,❤️ no need to tell anything . Every one knows about I phone.
3290,4,"Top notch performance, get it if you have budget and want a reliable Smartphone for long term.  Still apple need some improvement in display like high refresh rate, smaller notch or full screen display may be."
3291,5,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
3292,5,Got iPhone 12 128 gb version for just 52k during October 2021 big billion sale.. This would be the cheapest price in 2021 to get this brand new iPhone in India.. Performance of phone and its brilliant cameras are just mind blowing.. Really love this phone a-lot.. Battery backup could have been better.. but still it's manageable.. Thank you Flipkart for providing this phone for such a affordable price
3293,4,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.  Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."
3294,5,"Using iPhone since 5S onwards, it's never been a single thought to switch any other mobiles other than Apple. And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.  Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.  Thanks for quick delivery."
3295,5,Got a genuine product. Checked the serial number online as well and it all matched. Works like a charm. Fast as ever. Worth the money
3296,5,"Stunning look, very premium, awesome camera, I have a moderate use so I get 2 days battery life in single charge, overall very happy with the purchase and last but not the least Fast delivery by Flipkart."
3297,5,Awesome battery as expected and the product is way better than it's other phone. Unique face ID works in no light makes it more efficient. Overall a good geniune product and highly recommend.
3298,5,"First thing is I need to thank the seller for giving the original iPhone 12 for such a great pice. Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.  Now coming to the packing ,it was packed well and no damage was there. My old Samsung phone was exchanged for a good price and was also picked up by them.  I am really enjoying my first iPhone. Battery i am getting o..."
3299,4,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment. Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.  Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.  I will start with....."
3300,4,Such a great phone with great features…excellent camera and display….decent battery life .. value for money phone …beast like processor ❤️❤️❤️ You can go for this without any hesitation … if u want to use a phone for long term simply go for this (128 gb) …
3301,4,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."
3302,5,Best mobile phone ever…..just go for it…..excellent battery life….no issue in battery….display is mind blowing….sound is like jhakkas….everything is perfect…i will mention one time more very nice battery backup…whole day n more also…if u use wisely your phone with proper settings….worth the value…and thank u Flipkart for fast delivery.
3303,5,"An absolute charm to have this phone in your hands. Flipkart delivered in the next day in the BBD sale. Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition. And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
3304,5,"Perfect iPhone . Glad that I Pick iPhone 12 instead of iPhone 11 , Prices are bit high but Features are completely fill that Price Gap . I love that Device . Happy User 😁"
3305,4,Definitely an awesome product...an awesome experience if you are upgrading from android.... Bgmi experience is unmatched... The performance and day to day activities on the mobile is way different than any other can offer.... My suggestion is ..if you can afford it....you may go if you are a lover of quality over quantity.. Battery is okay...neither like it cant even run few hours nor like it will run till days...in between...you can take it with a little over mild usage....for 6 to 7 hours.....
3306,5,Writing this review after 50 days of ‘heavy’ use.  • The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.  • Battery performance is also good. While playing heavy games continuously it gives a backup of around 4hrs and around 3-1/2 hrs with screen recording. If u are not playing heavy games then the battery will last all day long and there will be still left around 20%...
3307,5,Save few bucks and buy this and avoid 13. Used this for a year and great compact beast if you got money to waste else restrict yourself for under 30k androids. Not having great of everything but still best as it got everything you need in top notch phone.
3308,5,Appreciated with product!!!!!! It's amazing🤩 when I ordered there was so many doubt related products quality and refurbished Or duplicate... But when it was reached its amazing experience. Phone was fully packed as it bought from showroom...... And same with warranty... Warranty is in accurately activated by system... Very good product
3309,5,Using apple after 3 years last I was using 6plus and after that S8 iOS is good if you are in this apple ecosystem otherwise I will ask everyone to stick to android Camera is really good on this one Speaker quality is amazing Performance top notch Battery life is fantastic it will last full day in heavy uses
3310,5,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.
3311,5,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️
3312,5,"Pros: - Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me. - Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android) - Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours. - Square-shaped design co..."
3313,5,My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios  Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.  Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.  The display is gorgeous. One of the best.
3314,5,Awesome product… Camera: it’s superb. Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use. Display and design : perfect. iPhone 12 is looking so premium and best till date. Performance: perfect and very smooth and premium. Colour: i prefer Green because it looks more light green and different than others and ofcourse it gives premium look… 2nd option can be white. Flipkart order : firstly I hesitated to buy from flipkart as it is of bug amount but I ordered and got my phone one day ...
3315,5,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand. Each and every specification of the phone is worth the money. So just go ahead and purchase it without any second thought. I pre-ordered it and received the product on time. Thanks Flipkart for prompt service.
3316,5,Stunning Phone from IPhone at Stunning price. 1. Good Display. 2. Good Looking Ceramic coated iPhone 12. 3. Performance rocket. 4. Camera awesome with added apps for photo n video. Seamlessly great
3317,5,My final review after using it for whole one week. Awesome Was a Hard Androider but as I switched really loving iOS Know. Guys the product is geniune please those who are saying flipcart is fake and all. Belive me it's an trustworthy Family. I thanks My seller and the entire team of Flipcart Thank you so much. Regards.
3318,5,"Worth the money invested. My first iPhone and it could not have been better than this. The look, the ease of use, the security and the display+camera it's just awesome."
3319,4,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."
3320,5,Firstly I would like to thanks Flipkart for one day delivery with secure & safe. Its realy awesome phone. I loved it. This is my first IPhone which I have swep from android to ios. White colour provide premium look. Tea Cup Pic is from IPhone 12
3321,3,"An apple fan, I find iPhone 12 light, easier to use than iPhone 11 as is compact in size and weight, display is a little better than iPhone 11, speed is also better and satisfactory. To my disappointment; there was no charger and no earphones in the box. Also the price strategy of apple for its products in india is positioned much higher than the developed countries while it should have been the other way round as the capacity to pay of people of developing nations like india is much lower th..."
3322,5,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones. Would definitely recommend to both iOS and android users. Good enough cameras, nice display with slim and “equal” bezels, overall a really great experience"
3323,4,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me! I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats. 1. Picture gets pixelated when you try to zoom in even after 30 to 40% of actual image 2. Though the device houses the fastest chip across the globe (at the time of release), it still take couple of seco..."
3324,5,"This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week review Pros 1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable 2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di..."
3325,5,"If you are first time ios user u are surely going to miss few things frm android but the sense of security u get frm ios is unquestionable , and about the device its upto the mark the screen is so fluid that u will love it and battery optimisation is also top notch all the games i hv tried run buttery smooth so if u are ready to compromise on some features u can definitely go for it"
3326,5,As always awesome product by Apple and Nice timely and safe delivery by Flipkart. First confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal
3327,5,"Review after 15 days: Upgraded from iPhone X Excellent phone with amazing battery back up, easily last a day with high usage. Fast charging is also great. Charged 30% to > 80% within 30 mins. Not to mention Camera quality. All iPhone have great camera quality. But upgrading from iPhone X, this phone’s camera quality is even better with better crispness and great in low light. LED screen is pretty awesome. You can get great pictures and videos steaming. Design is pretty awesome. Flat edges..."
3328,5,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
3329,5,"Blazing Fast experience with Great Camera quality, light weight and super handy with superb Call quality. Iphone 12 is a Must buy!"
3330,4,"Delivery is super fast, after using it for 2 weeks, camera quality is superb, very smooth UI, compact and very light weight. 1st week everything was good, but after that auto rotate feature stopped working and eSim calls disconnecting frequently, contacted apple support but issues not yet resolved."
3331,5,"Finally got the most awaited iPhone 12 with favourite white. With this purchase I have now a complete Apple products family range includes MacBook IPad and now iPhone 12. Very easy to initiate after denoting the iPhone as I had migrated all the data quickly with signing in. Well it was a great deal with Flipkart, off course I got the the phone in two days after placing an order. It’s been a few weeks now using iPhone, it’s different experience altogether. Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."
3332,5,"I recently upgraded to the iPhone 12 and I have no regrets. The phone is very sleek, streamlined and svelte looking, especially in the red color, which I prefer. The phone works flawlessly, with great audio and a decent speaker, for voice or music. The text feature, likewise, is extremely easy to use and intuitive. The phone takes excellent pictures, rivaling many stand-alone cameras and equipment, and the panoramic feature is very useful and cool. The other apps work great as well and open q..."
3333,5,"Superb phone from apple. Buttery smooth and blazingly fast. Just missing telephoto camera at this price. This could be provided by Apple. Also charger is not coming along. At this price customer expects that.  Nothing else to complain about. It is very good looking, compact and light weight. Master piece from Apple."
3334,5,Good experience iPhone 12 mobile Camera clarity good quality Battery full charged 1 hour Display quality good 8k Overall mobile is good Flipkart Fast deliver 1day
3335,4,"The only benefit of an iPhone is its Camera and Display. I have been an Android user for the past 8 years and it worked perfectly fine for me. iPhone has its advantages, but one of the things that frustrates me the most is interface: 1. Like there is no alternative to FaceID, you have to enter your passcode while wearing mask/helmet or when there is not enough light, no fingerprint sensor, nothing 2. Many apps have a lot of bugs even in their latest version and the companies don’t care to fix..."
3336,4,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.
3337,4,Best mobile ever reasonable deal and zest money best

3340,4,"It is really a nice product by apple but there are some disappointments too. First the battery is small, and that’s why the phone is very light (this is the advantage), If you are updating from iphone 6 or 7 you will not mind but if u are updating from phone 11 then you would definitely find a difference. Second thing the display is not that bright. I compared it with iPhone 11 and 7 plus and saw that 11 and 7 plus both were more bright. Third when we use the camera for like more than 5-10 mi..."
3341,4,Camera pe perfect. Screen is good but smaller then the other smart phone which are half on price. Price was good on big billion day but not on diwali sale. Don’t understand the point of buying the charger saprately.

3344,4,"Overall a good phone but camera is not as it was hyped. May be software update can change the camera quality. Specifically, the portrait edge detection is not at all good. Other than that the build and finish is excellent. Display is very good. The phone is responsive. Overall a very good phone but not a phone to be priced above 60 - 65K for 128 GB."
3345,5,"Well i returned back to iphone after ip7 because original is original and no one can replace the same.  Whether in terms of usage or performance , features iphone excel in all of these.  Phone Audio quality is best and no phone could match that pure natural sound , you will love it  Rest phone display is excellent OLED with 460PPI text and videos look amazing and built quality is very good.  Now most important part that no other phone could match is its software. Both os and apps are very goo..."
3346,3,"Spent around 50k, the phone is beautiful in every way but it has some serious flaws as well.. Camera doesn't have pause button can you imagine? While incoming calls you cant get option to reject the calls.. calculator doesn't have history option.. no pro option in camera though video and photo quality is top notch. Found some very unique features and love them but still finding not worth 50k phone.."
3347,5,One of the best phone I purchased. It is good to invest on such phones. It is a fantastic product. I love using it.
3348,5,"It’s powerful performance Good choice to buy, But display should be full Screen like Samsung Amoled.. Go for it , Gd quality HD pictures u can click.."
3349,5,"Once an Apple user always an Apple user! Started off with an iPad and the experience with it lead me to buy an iPhone ..... It’s on a different level ... luxurious phone from a luxurious brand ..

To Flipkart customer care 0 star, since they are dumb and will only reply copy paste message. To product, what to say it's an iPhone.... Over all the product safely reached out, I would suggest to go with while or green color as they look awesome. For longer usage, as I generally do not change iphone I went for 128 gb..."
3352,5,"Upgraded from Iphone X. If you are in Apple ecosystem, this is a good phone to upgrade. I'm glad I chose this phone 12 over 12 pro. The extra sensor and lens in pro is not worth the extra 35000 IMO. The delivery was perfect and right on time! Thanks Flipkart!"
3353,5,"Everything is superb and the most I liked in this phone is its Design and Camera and coming on battery life, it is also perfect for me lasted for more than one day as I mostly use my phone for surfing and sometimes for watching video. Really ❤️ it."
3354,4,1. Battery drains very fast. 2. Photo quality superb. 3. Cannot migrate from android to ios. Move to ios app is not effective and good. 4. Android is far better in handling. 5. Power adapter was not provided. Got it after 01 month from flipkart (separately purchased). Till now charging with my Samsung A50. 6. Overall not satisfied at all.
3355,5,"1. Got my phone within 3 days after placing the order. So before time delivery which was good. 2. I have purchased Blue colour iPhone (128GB variant). I was confused with which colour to buy and finally purchased blue colour which looks amazing. 3. Overall feel is excellent and quite handy to use with one hand and also very light weight. 4. OLED screen is definitely a big plus. 5. Speed, Touch screen, Gaming experience is really good. 6. Switched from Android to IOS, initially took sometime(1..."
3356,5,"Really happy with the purchase. Better battery life, nice camera loved it"
3357,5,Awesome Device !! Picture quality is superb... Camera is also top quality even in low light ... I'm so satisfied ... Thank you Flipkart and Apple ! ;)
3358,5,"It was a fantastic purchase. Based on initial review, the product is delivered before time, exchange process was smooth less.  The service by flipkart was amazing, as received a call regarding my purchase and if I have any complains.  Phone: Functioning well, camera is efficient and above market standard. Battery is smooth, works whole day for me. I just charge everyday for 30-50 min. Will update the review soon"
3359,4,"Awesome camera, awesome battery life and amazing speed. The size is perfect for someone looking for a phone that fits comfortably in the pocket and in the hand. Suitable for one handed use. Sound could have been slightly better but not a major issue. Wish apple had to provide a complete charger."
3360,5,The flipkart delivery was good and the delivery guy opened the pack in front of me as per the steps described. He also asked me to check all the checkpoints to identify if phone was in a good condition. Iphone 12 is amazing and had a good battery life. Lasts 1.5 day with normal use and 4g services shut down when not required. Has a amazing processing speed
3361,3,"Overall good mobile, apart from so called big brand, nothing special in it. Camera is gud but not wow like Samsung s21+or ultra which I am currently using. Yes performance is really top class. You will not see any lag. Battery could have be better."
3362,5,Best phone best performance Best camera perfect Brand light weight Best screen in class
3363,5,"Great Product from Apple. Go for iphone 12 however if like to invest 40k more for one more camera, 180 nits brightness difference (which you cannot differentiate b/w both of them) and slight design difference then go for iphone 12 pro.  Otherwise iphone 12 gives you all the features which an individual wants in a good phone."
3364,5,One of my best buy on Flipkart as well as my first iPhone. Just loving it more & more. Big billion day sale was deal breaker for me...❤️
3365,5,WORTH EVERY PENNY….. Awesome battery life. Camera is top notch 🔥🔥 Display is good Audio output also good . In case of performance it is a beast no comparison. BGMI runs super smooth. IOS experience is awsome super smooth. Buy 20W apple charger fast charging is superb 🔥 This is my first iPhone and I just loved it 😍 Thanks Flipkart for deliver genuine product.
3366,5,I liked the display and performance is very good and I purchased it in big billion offer. I got it reasonable price
3367,5,Upgraded me from iPhone XR. It feels like an upgrade for sure. It approx 30gm lighter and the overall experience is flawless. Anyways nothing more to say about Apple as a brand. :)
3368,5,At first i was sceptic to switch from Android to IOS. Then after all the research and reviews I bought Iphone 12 and i can assure it is absolute pleasure to use IPhone and camera is just masterpiece. The right decision at right time.
3369,5,This is the best iphone to buy compared to 12 pro. Black colour is way better than blue Screen is quad hd and not full hd which is found in samsung s21 plus at the same price range. Rest functioning is buttery smooth Face id works like charm Don’t worry of smudges as they are not that prominent if u are looking at phone directly but in 12 category i think you should go for only this colour option besides white. Matt sides are good for handling and there are no smudge problem there.
3370,5,Excellent battery life - for non gamer like me and great camera received the product in 24 hr of ordering without any extra charge......Amazon asks for extra money for same.....thanks Flipkart
3371,5,Excellent product and excellent prompt service by Flipkart. iPhone 12 is value for money phone and Flipkart made it possible in big billion day sale. Offer the same Kind of discounts on Apple AirPod pro in coming sale.
3372,4,If u want to buy phone to not much work it worth. If u want to multitask go with Android. It video quality is awesome specially 4k 60fps. Very nice phone.
3373,4,"Everything is fine can live without a higher refresh display but the battery life is not satisfactory.batter life could be better to make it a perfect flagship, moderate to heavy users need to charge it twice. Overall a good product."
3374,5,"Satisfactory product but when you’re shifting from android to iPhone than you are facing some problems like as you can not use third party apps, no free app for music but when you’re using this product you’ll being comfortable with this."
3375,5,It’s a very light phone I totally loved the performance of this phone Shifting from android to IOS has some initial challenges but now I am use to it its a perfect fit phone in hand Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day. Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also.
3376,4,"Much hyped... Good for a BBD purchase 51k, usable for a normal user.. Got it for my wife, she loved it.. Personally, Android flagship model user, love the SD 888 performance... Can vouch for the iOS, nothing superior if you have proper hardware.. hope apple support will be strong... Go for it if you love the brand gimik..."
3377,5,"I am writing this review after 1month!! First of all I would say that this is totally overpowered phone. As I am a gamer I hav youtube channel so it's really support all high level games. I have done streaming also its run smoothly. But battery should get more as I have to charger daily at 2 times(heavy user!😉). Its really support my work. Really a most powerful phone with A14 bionic chip, greatest chipset for 2020 to 2022 as I think because it is the winner chipset in 2021. I will highly re..."
3378,5,"First time I purchased a smartphone on Flipkart and my experience is awesome. I received genuine product and delivery of product is within time frame. I’m an android user and first time switched to IOS, iPhone 12 is up above my expectations and happy to have it. I got a great deal from Flipkart. Thanks Flipkart team for blast past fast deal."
3379,4,"Ok here’s the thing. The only thing apart from the charger that will probably make you think twice ‘why apple, you could have at least added this’ is the Apple earphones. At least a wired one. That’s not much of an impact but at one moment it will for sure hit you. Otherwise it’s an amazing phone. The best so far."
3380,4,"Seriously I didn’t the camera quality better, I was using 6 and now moved to 12 but 6 camera quality is good in terms of worth of the product however overall product is really nice"
3381,5,After switching from 6s I realised the super phone is this one iphone12. It’s display feels like a liquid with the finger swipe. Awesome to avail with an offer.
3382,5,"I had been an iphone 6 user for some 5 years after that, i switched to android, eventually i was tired of changing android phones as they lasted a year, plus the security issues, so i decided to get back to apple, and i was pensive regarding the high price tag, and reminded myself of the iOS performance, quality in camera, smooth interactivity, and apple service.  After few months of research, i discarded the iphone 13 choice which was 20k more, and went for iphone 12, and i was pleased, this..."
3383,5,Apple is always the best when it comes to phones. Got a great deal during the big billion flipkart sale. Seller Supercom net was awesome 😊 Genuine product
3384,5,Except for battery life everything is great . Easy to handle and use . Perfomance is great . If u want to buy it for camera then also check out oneplus nord 2 . Oneplus nord 2 has the best camera(sony 50 mp lens) in all the oneplus phones and tough competition to iphone 12 .
3385,4,Got it for 53K. Upgraded from Oneplus 7. Good software. Very smooth and lag free. No heating issue while using. Video clarity is really great. Battery is good for one day of heavy usage. I used to end up my busy schedule at 6pm with around 30% battery  Compared to Oneplus 7 still camera is lack of colours. I felt like all photos washed out of colours. Front camera is really bad. Display also lack of good punch in terms of colours. My Oneplus life was really colourful in-terms of camera an...
3386,3,Just brand value. Andriod mobiles much lower than this price gives better features. I bought this phone for camera but compared to other mobiles like oneplus 9 and nord iphone does not give better images. No optical zoom.
3387,5,i really loved it but apple should give a large display like 8plus i had switched 8plus to 12 but m not really happy wd the size
3388,5,"Upgraded after 4.5 years of using iPhone SE, although the older one is still adequate for day to day use, the battery and camera started to bug me. I wanted to get a new phone that can be used for another 5-6 years and it could only have been an iPhone. Looking at the battery degradation over the time, 12 seemed like a better option than 12 mini.  Coming from a budget unit to a relatively flagship one has been a great experience.  Pros: Cameras, Display, Usability - gestures are way more int..."
3389,5,"Yes yes yes, I was planning for 1 year to purchase a good iPhone but fortunately I got this iphone 12 (128) Variant which is beyond my expectation, only 51 k with the charger. Thank you Flipkart to provide me a super opportunity to get it owned."
3390,5,I thinks its a good phone to have. Not the best but certainly better than the pro models
3391,5,Wonderful experience with this new gorgeous iPhone . I upgraded from 6s to 12 and it’s simply awesome. It’s looking super cute and working well .
3392,5,Loving the switch from an Android. Very smooth to use. Battery performance could be better but I do use it extensively also. Size is also perfect and love the purple colour.
3393,5,It’s an amazing photo. Looks nice feels nice and great to use. Extremely lightweight for hand and pocket. Perfect size for one hand usage.
3394,5,Camera quality is just fabulous. Interface is very smooth. Good for photography and videography.

3440,3,"Not sure if FLIPKART would dare to keep this review. But if it clicks,then good. I won't review about iPhone12,because its my waste of time. We all are smart enough to watch videos rather than reading reviews here for iPhone. Review (For your safety): Make sure you keep all proofs especially video, while opening the box and initial check like dents,scratches etc etc within hour of delivery.  Why its required? If you share photo or make delay in informing,you will realise that no one in the wo..."

3459,5,Excellent quality camera. Feels premium. Superior performance. Flipkart service as always best.
3460,1,"Every thing is good in iphone, One thing is disappointed to me, Why charger adapter not provided by the company. Already you pay much more ammount and after that now again you have to pay for adapter. this is very disgusting according to my opinion."

3463,5,"Pros :- Great Performance Great Camera Great sound quality for calls Great Display - Finally OLED in the non pro phones  Cons :- Battery life - Although iOS is very optimised, still could have been a little better Price - Not value for money as compared to other android phones  For existing apple users don't update if you're coming from iPhone X or 11 series. Won't feel much of an update For others, buy it if you're looking for a change from Android or if you're looking to get into the apple..."

3467,1,Flipkart service is just pathetic and they are the worst online shopping app. *They canceled my order too many times. *Delivery was too late for days. *they makes false statements about resolution. *wont recommend FLIPKART to the serious and sensitive customers.

Thanks to Flipkart, device was on 72k, added to cart got 3k discount and I made the bill 1 lakh for which 5k icici offer got applied.  I'm not going to review the phone, obviously tons of youtube videos have them .  My two cents but any screen guard cheap/ costly. 12 has a very high shatter proof glass but side effects of not shattering is the glass is easily scratched . And buy a case for y..."

3487,5,i am using this iphone12(black) since feb 1. i am so happy. iam enjoying so much with this. i loved ur service. no fake delivery i got brand new iphone. the function of this phone is super. the only one thing which make me feel little bit sad is its potrait camera becoz of lacked telephoto lens. we cannot take zoomed potrait photos. in my view 2x zoom sholud be given in potrait mode according its price. AT LAST I WANT TO SAY THNKS TO FLIPKART AND ITS TEAM FOR UR FAITHFUL DELIVERY.
3488,5,"OMG…. Value for money. Though I had used IPhone earlier iPhone SE/iPhone 7 but this device and his processor 14B processing pictures like amazing. I’ve started exploring and capturing candid and uploading too on social websites. Before this I used to little hesitated but now have confidence. What I’ve got apart from device in box is happiness, satisfaction, confidence, change view to look beauty around… Charging cable and SIM tray ejection pin too.  Happy Customer! 😊"

3497,5,Updated myself from Iphone XR
3498,2,Worst experience. Battery performance is very poor. Phone getting heat in one call only. I will not advise to buy online. After sale no support from Flipkart. Better to buy from store. At least you will get genuine product.
3499,5,"I would use the Old Commercial tagline of Apple to describe it in one line, “If You Don’t have an iPhone, Well You Don’t have an iPhone”. P.S - I have uploaded Outdoor, Indoor, Day light and Night Pictures to show the Magnificent Camera Quality."

3510,1,Just don't buy expensive things here go somewhere else 1. Please check properly before giving otp at time of OPEN BOX DELIVERY 2. Check from every ANGLE I got scammed because of this In the pics you can see when light reflectes on it you cant see the scratch But actually there is a scratch which at delivery wasn't visible due to reflection
3511,5,"Well always being user of Apple devices doesn’t makes my think about something new. As everyone knows the things remain same but the way things are advertised are different. But the things had changed now. This new iPhone 12 should be bought with all the MagSafe accessories if you want to enjoy this technology beast. Be it camera, performance, multi tasking or whatever a smartphone can do, this thing does it better. Go for it."

5006,4,Best Samsung phone in this price range.Good battery back up.Decent Display.Fast fingerprint sensor.Rear camera quality is good.front camera is not up to the mark.90 Hz refresh rate is good.Good user interface.updated to one ui 3.1.there are some pre installed apps which can only be disabled.sound quality is low comparing with other smartphones in same price segment.using in low screen bightness noticed screen flickering.There is no screen protector or case in the box.Takes 160 minutes for ful...
5007,4,"Amazing smartphone. Camera , battery back up , display , are awesome 👌. It has a little bit heating problem but not at all . Amazing smartphone for students becoz I'm using as a student .😊😊. It is heavy also , this is a bad point for this smartphone. But all good . ND I'm satisfied . Delivery was also good 👍. Thanks flipkart. 😊"
5008,5,This smartphone is very good in camera and battery And value for money from Samsung with clean and smooth Ui and good battery life also
5009,4,First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone
5010,4,"Nice phone. We can rely on Samsung than any Chinese company like MI, Redmi, Poco, Realme, Vivo, Oppo etc.  Little heavy and thick than others but best in this price range. Rear and front cameras are superb. Not has SAmoled display and you can't expect it in this price. 6000 mah battery is just wow. Power packed phone.  But the Charger is of 9V and there is mentioned that it is of 15V.  It did justice with its price. Value for money and trust of Samsung.  If you are willing for it, Go ahead 👍"
5011,5,"Best mobile for in this price range, Battery backup is highlight. Better go with this mobile in budget category from best brand. Absolutely perfect mobile."
5012,5,"Camera is good battery is good fingure unlock sensor is very good and fast it is very thick due to large battery this phone is not for slim phone lovers but phone is very good and price are also good , good job samsung"
5013,5,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.
5014,5,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous. As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ..."
5015,1,The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.  Now with cons (there are multiple) Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull. There is over brightness on display...
5016,5,It's fantastic phone actually . Especially battery backup is very good upto 2days with a single charge.. it's nearly 1/4 kg.. Anyway best phone under 12k
5017,5,"Using the phone for the last 13 days.  •The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.  •I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.  •The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.  • Overall, I love this phone. No complains."
5018,4,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI
5019,5,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.
5020,4,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.
5021,4,*Display is great.... No such phone can provide this type of display like galaxy F12 in this range...  *Battery is mind blowing.... Even after heavy usage.. it gave a backup upto 2 days ...  *Performance is ok.... For normal use no such problems.... But heavy gaming is not mandatory...  *Camera is also good... Shutter is a bit low but you cam click some outstanding pictures from the back camera.... But the selfie camera is below average.... Need to improve a lot...  Overall this is a great ph...
5022,4,Overall good camera and battery phone in this price. Camera quality is very good. Battery also good last upto 2 days. Performance good like any other samsung mobile. Sound quality is very good.  Phone is little bit heavy due to 6000mAh battery. Back panel looks outdated.  Overall good phone in this budget range.
5023,5,"Best clean budget phone. If you need a clean. And good simple degine working performance. It's best. And if you need best of the best photo, then plz buy a DSLR not a phone."
5024,4,"Low light camera is not good , selfie is average but looking wise it's a good product . Performance is good with average gaming Battery pick up also good  Overall value for money"
5025,5,It is very very nice and it's is Battery preformance is awesome it can for 3days and it performance of the chip inside super more faster .camera also good .
5026,5,"Go for it if u r not a ardent game lover like pubg,cod. 4 out of 5 for this budget range.  Good build quality Pros: Definitely the battery. It's real good Display looks good. No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly Back camera is good.  Cons: Selfie camera could ve been better. As Mi phones offer good camera quality for this price range No back cover. Even simple one. High wattage battery, but atleast takes 2hours to full charge."
5027,5,Really amazing 👏😍product I'm totally satisfied with it if anyone is willing to purchase a new phone I will recommend you to purchase I have also ordered another same product for my mother it's really nice u can rely on it value for money 💰
5028,1,it's not very good but battery is good processor is not very good so if we have to do gaming then it is not better for us
5029,4,"Best mid range mobile from samsung , back camera is good but front camera is avarage. Performance is good although good phone in this price range."
5030,5,I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good. Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.
5031,1,"Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people."
5032,4,Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .
5033,5,It is a good quality product and it is better then my expectations....... It's a cool phone. As it's a med range phone..
5034,5,"Very nice product according to price. delivered next day after booking. Camera, battery, display good. Every one may buy with out any doubts. I recommend it to Samsung lovers. LOVELY MOBILE."
5035,5,"Nice Phone in samsung budget series I love samsung products quality , after sale service , the support, security updates all in all great company ...."
5036,5,"Pros:- Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation. Samsung brand is trust. Phone is Durable and service centre are very helpful This is myth exynos are not good. Trust me, in real life in doesnt matter until and unless you do heavy gaming at very high..."
5037,4,"Personally i feel the design of this phone is very nice and impressive. Camera quality is good in this price point. Performance is also good in this range Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it. Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it..... Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it."
5038,4,Good features and camera quality is good and powerful battery and nice and auto call recorder option is also available if don't want auto call recorder option manual call recorder option is also available but the problem is we should have click tow time to open any thing other good phone value of money and most recommended
5039,5,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof 😍 Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user. Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that. Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one. In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG."
5040,5,"Superb Phone......  Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.  Pros: 1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage 2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use. 3. Camera is decent. As always Samsung camera is very good. 4..."
5041,3,"Listing out only most desirable points to know from realtime usage. Others you'll find on online reviews.  Pros: Efficient battery. It doesn't go well with gaming though Handling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case Good build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress  Cons: Mediocre camera for this segment. At this price you'll get awesome image quality from Mi, Realme and others. Sound ..."
5042,4,Review after 3 month of use:  1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5 2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5 3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5 4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5
5043,5,This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.And also the delivery boy was very cooperative
5044,5,Fabulous budgeted phone. Use to gift 🎁my wife she is very happy with this fantastic gift and amazing performance. 5star to this mobile and Samsung too❤.
5045,5,"Very well balanced phone - Camera, Battery, Display & Antennas - best in this budget. Additionally, an excellent software experience!"
5046,5,Good option for normal users. It will be good if a back case is provided along with the package. 6000mah battery might not as good as others. But for a Samsung phone this is the best option. Quad camera set is is just okay. Macro shots and all are just average. But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range. The display is fine. Much brighter and clearer one. The phone is little bulky but it won't be a problem for us. For gamers you may skip this phone. This is not ...
5047,4,"Great Product , If You want to buy a new branded phone and you have only a less amount in your hand , then no problem just buy this and use its fantastic. I Bought a Black one , that's great in real but not good in photos..."
5048,4,"I loved the part of delivery from Flipkart and a good phone in this budget especially when it is NOT CHINESE and MADE IN INDIA.  For a regular use, this phone is nice with good battery and camera.  Just 1 star is less because, it feels thicker than expected. Rest everything is perfect."
5049,3,"Very good Shape nice battery, performance is okay. overall value for money. It will be great phone if it gets better display and speakers than this"

5052,4,Ph is looking good & camera is awesome but some features are missing as per the comparison of MI 9 PRIME & let me see in future how is it work ?
5053,5,Nice Phone especially bought for battery backup. Its battery backup is awesome. Pretty good camera and everything at all nice phone.
5054,5,1st time using Samsung and the experience is awesome nice phone with big battery and nice camera and awesome performance. The software experience is also great.
5055,2,"Awesome product & I have ordered this product on the 1st day,its performance is good & battery is also good,its look also good but this model similar to galaxy A12, M12."
5056,3,"You use it as a secondary phone not primary And the pros are 1 big battery 2 big storage 3 processor is all right Cons 1 display not that good 2 camera is ok not upto the mark 3 audio is not upto the mark You can go for micromax in note 1, it's far better than this"
5057,4,"Pros: i) In this budget Samsung F12 is a good phone. ii) Very nice interface, easy to use, 90 Hz refresh rate. iii) 6000mAh battery back up is too good for heavy use. Cons: i) Front camera is very average in quality. ii) Little bit heavy due to 6000mAh battery. iii) Sound quality is comparatively low with other smartphones."
5058,5,Camera is very good and best is battery this phone can be used for 2 days without charging  Today after using 3 hours this phone consume only 5 percent battery and with very fast charging  And I bought this phone only at 7500
5059,5,Selfie camera is not much good as expected. Main camera is ok. But the rest of all the performance is the best I loved it too much. The 90hz display performs like pro. Very very fast response of screen. Battery lasts whole day long for online classes. Overall it's a beast in this budget.
5060,5,I had bought it for my children and they liked it very much.. Its worth every penny.. Absolutely a smart buy in this price range.... 👌👌
5061,5,The best phone among all on this price range Camera is awesome. Battery is monster. Everything is just perfect. So happy to buy it Thank you Samsung Thank you flipkart.👍
5062,5,Super valuable phone I like this phone I am so happy thank you flipkart ...
5063,5,"Literally the best of Samsung in this price range.  Camera quality is really good, not the best, but OK. The 48mp rear camera is the best, other three cams are not upto the mark. The selfish camera is better.  Battery lasts upto 1 day even on continuous use but it takes time for charging.  It is not recommended for gamers, but for a regular user or student who uses for attending online classes, calls, multitasking, It is highly recommended.  Display is amazing. Adaptive 90hz display is very s..."
5064,4,"A nice product in affordable range. After Using Vivo, Redmi and Micromax , which boast of good Camera quality and attractive accessibility options but finally ends in software/ hardware issue, sluggish performance i have returned to Samsung after 3 years.

Overall, recommended for purchase in th..."
5065,3,"Camera is not as per expectations,there is nothing like 48MP quality in clicked images,performance of front camera is also not good. Performance is good in this price range,battery is awesome and display is ok."
5066,5,Good phone at this priceing & and this phone is unique to all phones at this priceing and features. Everytime you note that samsung is BRAND. BATTERY 🔋 is awesome 😉 take a long time to drain and Runs 1 day with full charge . Gaming performance is still good but not much.Like BGMI you play at low graphics then performance of this mobile is too good. I like this phone 📱

My bad luck was that the Realme Narzo 50A was automatically canceled due to the heavy traffic, and I got the Samsung Galax..."
5068,4,Product delivered on time. Phone seems good right now but it is heavy maybe due to big size. Charging takes a lot of time but the battery backup is good. I am satisfied with the the product but not delighted.
5069,5,"Bought this as a second phone. Was looking for a cheap reliable one. So went for a Samsung phone. Given the price, the display, call clarity and performance are good. Camera is also reasonably good. But then if camera was main function one needed, the budget would have to be stepped up. So overall, a very good phone for everyday use"
5070,4,Good phone with Good Performance Back camera is good and front is average Battery backup is too good ! 6000 mh battery last long for almost 1 day of use! Ram plus feature is available in this samsung smartphone after update! Overall a very good phone for students who are not so much engage in gaming!
5071,4,Overall Satisfied 👍👍  Pros: 1. Big Display + Good build quality 2. Sharp Colors 3. Good battery backup lasts for almost 1.5 days 4. Smooth touch + clean UI 5. No lags until now + no heating issue 6. Rear camera works pretty good in day light  Cons: 1. Front camera is average 2. No back cover provided 3. Feels little heavy in initial days but later gets used too it.
5072,2,"1. camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update). But many features. 2. Smooth performance. Though Sometimes it slows down while multi-tasking in high speed. But it is quite natural for any phone. It has pop up. Split windows and many more. Amazing. 3. No hitting issue.   4. Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use. 5. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.  .. . ....NO APP LOCK, NO COMPASS. ......  🧸 APP LOCK AND MORE SENSORS COULD BE GIVEN."
5073,5,Very nice mobile phone...I am feeling very happy after received this product.... Camera is well ..... And thanks to flipkart for delivery in very short time a carefully also....
5074,4,"Reviewing after 2 days use. Mobile has heating problem while usingand charging. Overall features are best. Go for this mobile. But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phone😇. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome 👌"
5075,5,"Samsung f12 best build quality,heavy battery life,Knox security, advertisement free system,no heating issue,fast charging,no lag,unloacking very fast,90 hz display is more better than full HD display of Chinese phone,Dolby atmos audio...I think samsung show their build quality in their phones in all segments...must buy ...flipkart deliver boy is nice ..he waiting for me 3 hour...and good delivery ..thanks flipkart"
5076,4,"Phone is very good but there is no screen guard and phone cover , Samsung should give this.  Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad ."
5077,5,Very best phone for the price according to lg w30 and w31 model with same specification are costing more for the price it is best and awsome to use very perfect for office use i have stored 62 gb full of data but it doesnot hang till now very awsome for the price and battery stands for 2 days
5078,4,As per this rate its good deal for me. I like it because i am not heavy user or gamer so i like it. Display is Little bit not because its not Amoled display.
5079,5,Review based on 2 weeks usage. Good phone overall. Decent camera. Good display. Very good battery backup. Samsung product query support claim gorilla glass but do not explicitly mention on their website.
5080,5,I wanted a good configuration mobile at the least possible price. There were good and bad reviews for it online. But I decided to purchase it because of brand name Samsung.  After about a month I am writing this review that it is one of the best mobile at this price range. It's an confirmation that none of a mobile can be available at this price even Chinese but this is Korian so its good like anything..  I would recommend everyone to purchase this mobile when it's at low price of 10499/-.  T...
5081,4,"This is a good phone.A smart phone useful to the common man. But since it is a heavy phone, it cannot be used flexibly. Airtel SIM -internet connection is poor. The camera is good. Has voice clarity. The display is good. Performance is better. Battery capacity is excellent.  This phone is recommended👍"
5082,5,After using 4 to 5 days ... Camera is just OK not disappointed Battery is super more than 2 day if you are a normal user ... Display is also good .. Processor is also good Over all phone is good in this price range . You can go for it ....
5083,3,"If I am going with brand name SAMSUNG then it should be like super but in samsung f12 disappointed me . It's camera quality is not good ,it is 48 mp camera . If anybody want to buy this for thinking good camera I recommended to go with Realme. Battery backup also less ."
5084,2,Camera quality is poor.
5085,1,Like it's camera is is like 48mp. It's take too much time to charge. I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung . It's has very less features. It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter. It's screenshot taking method is worst. It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete. I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG.
5086,4,Poor camera. No night mode. Nice lock app not supported. Rest is good like performance and battery life. Software experience is great
5087,5,Phone look is awesome best suited for official use ...Firstime#samsung Thank u filpkart for speedy delivery
5088,5,It is a super phone in this price range . It camera is good. Display is good. In first time the battery Is not in function in after 2 days the battery is very good. In full charge it leads in 2 days . It is good performance and good quality . Display is good . You will buy you'll happy. In this price Samsung galaxy F12 is better than anthor mobiles
5089,4,"Good phone. Camera quality, display is good. Gives good battery backup. Only and main problem is sound quality. Volume of the phone is very low. music or videos cannot be enjoyed and we can't here properly if speaker is on during call. Also the Dolby Atmos feature is disabled in the phone and there's no option to enable it."

If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change Other than that there is nothing else to post If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO"" Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11"

5098,4,"Got this for my mom..infact the first ever Android based Samsung phone brought in my history.  Good things:  1. Feature set like 90hz display, Samsung pay and Samsung Knox support, Dolby Atmos support and even Widewine L1 despite HD resolution is good. 2. Excellent battery life. 3. Decent RAM management. 4. Good update timeline. 5. For 720p display the viewing angles is decent.   Things that could have been better: 1. Slightly better Exynos chipset would have been good, but no lags felt prob..."
5099,4,Overall performance is good for medium use. Battery life is pretty good. For those who's looking for playing High graphic games than don't go for it. Camera performance is also average. Not so high not that bad. It's Not perfect for Photography lover. And Yeah it's little bit heavy. Weight is around 240-250Gms.

5102,4,"I have never had a good experience with Samsung mobile before.So I always use a different brand of mobile.After reviewing of all good,the Samsung F12 galaxy was bought.  Quality of product & finishings too good in this price.Operating speed is excellent and easy accessible.Light weight.  The quality of pictures taken from all rear cameras are very good.But not good results of front camera with compare of different brand.  And also thanks to flipkart for very fast delivery within two days."
5103,5,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent"
5104,3,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price."
5105,5,Very very nice mobile in this price segment. Best battery backup and good processor.All specifications are best for this mobile. Thank you ❤ flipkart for this mobile.

5132,5,First of all its a Samsung brand with knox security so one can rely on this brand for security concerns. Best battery and a power efficienct processor One UI 3.1 has the best in the segment features on par with A series phones and finally its a NON- CHINESE brand . A proud Samsung user.

5171,5,I bought this phone for my mom...and previously She had a Techno In 1 smartphone..and Techno has the worst software We have ever used...I don't choose Realme and Poco as Galaxy F12 is secured by knox ( although no Samsung Pass and secure folder but those are additional features and Having knox always means it's securing data from thefts and vulnerabilities)....Front camera optimisation is very good..Rear camera is okk..but Samsung India should optimize that too..90hz is fine...no issues with ...

5181,1,"Getting very hot even in idle condition. Without using the mobile phone getting too hot. Battery got drained quickly. Not happy at all. And the worst part of Flipkart is its return policy, there is only replacement not return. Please don't buy this phone. Samsung is making fool, fed up with samsung quality."

5210,2,"Camera performance & display both are bad, then what is use of 6000 mAH battery? Just for calling 1000 mAH is sufficient. Not expected from Samsung. Flipkart refused to replace or return. Total waste of money"
5211,5,5 star product
5212,2,I just received Mobile and it seems very Heavy in weight . I wanted to gift to my younger sister but she do not like this product as not feeling comfortable to pick and can not take a long call directly due to weight. Let me check for applications based. Will update here soon

5224,1,"Worst phone by Samsung, I was using a Samsung galaxy j4+ 2Gb ram phone before and it was working better than this 4gb ram phone. Phone hangs on basic everyday apps, and heating issue as well. No wonder why Samsung loosing its base to xiomi worst purchase."

If you are looking for a phone with good camera quality, please dont but this. I have requested multiple times Flipkart to return the product, but rather than answering their call centre disconnect the phone."
5304,3,Samsung Phone Build is good. 4/5 Camera Not good 2/5 Performance Below Average 2/5 Samsung OneUI and Security 4/5 Phone Weight Too heavy.
5305,3,Camera quality is very bad when comparing with redmi phones. Performance is good. Worth to see it as 4GB Ram. No 5GHz wifi available. Have to live with 2.4Ghz only. UI is not impressive. Need to go for custom launcher to get rid of this ugly UI. Speaker sound is very low. Headphone effect is better. Fast charging charger is not as fast as redmi charger.
5306,5,All thing is good but camera is not good because no beauty pluse add

It's a perfect buyer harrasment."

5323,5,Nice products Samsung device
5324,1,"I am using samsung smartphones since 2012 and this is first time samsung disappointed me. Before this I was using Samsung M20 and M20 is far better then this phone. Even M20 5000 mah battery is good and long lasting compare to this F12 6000 mah.  Camera - below average, sometimes it didn't open and take much time to save image. Too much lag in Camera.  Battery- on paper it's 6000 mah but it's not even working as 5000 mah battery, charging time 2.5 hours to 3 hours and 15w charger is a joke on..."
5325,1,Horrible product Dont fell in trap
5326,1,Very very worst camera quality display quality is very worst cell performance is too low
5327,5,Nice
5328,1,Worst seller this product
5329,2,Worth if you buy in 9000 in 10000 it's OK but in 11000 they fool you. Display is bad camera is OK but speaker sound is very poor if you play song in speaker it's sound like old China mobile.
5330,1,Waste mobile in waste flipkart
5331,5,According to this price range very well
5332,5,Value for money..  It is a perfect mobile for gift to your parents or non heavy user family members. It's little bit heavy but with 6000 mah battery. 90hz rate IPS display is comparable to amoled screen.
5333,5,SAR value is high
5334,5,Camera is not that much excellent but good enough. Apart from this its superb !
5335,1,Worst phone dont but it guys... Bad camera quality Wrost phone.....

5340,5,Nice one
5341,2,"Really disappointed with display and front camera quality. Didn't expected that much poor display and camera from a brand like samsung, even my samsung J2 (5yr old) take far better selfie than this . the only good thing about this phone is battery backup, otherwise i feel totally waste of money.. Not at all recommended for female users..."
5342,3,"Ok for the money.Not bad.Only best thing is battery.For 2 days no tension about charging.Camera average, display average, processor average.Big draw back is charging speed.Very slow compare to other brands. Atleast 30w charger is required for this huge capacity.Best for average usage.Not good for gamers,photo enthusiastics."
5343,5,Value for money product
5344,5,good product awsome
5345,2,Camera is so dull Samsung f12 is not 48mp camera It's a 5 mp camera It's cheating with me
5346,3,"The camera in the day time is superb, but where in the low light conditions is average, and the display is good and it is value for money"
5347,1,Complete wastage of money. Display is worst. Cannot read screen due to extra whiteness. Screen movement slow. May be due to processor. Camera is worst. Samsung made fool . It's a complete waste of money.. Flipkart should arrange for replacement with better mobile with extra cost if a customer need. I am facing thermal throttling with my phone after using it for few hours with light usage. As this phone uses a powerful chipset this is not expected to happen.

5465,3,"Initially, I was not reviewing the phone but I thought I must give my opinion. The phone is good but not the perfect one. But, It can be chosen in this price range. 1. Finger sensor given on the edge becomes a difficult task to unlock the phone when it is covered by silicon cover. 2. 48 mega pixels are just to say, actually it doesn't perform as per 48MP."
5466,5,Phone is best choice
5467,4,Good
5468,3,Finger print scanner should be in the phone. With 48 megapixel camera no night mode is available and quality of photos are not as expected. Overall its an average phone.

5503,2,"You will not be the owner of this mobile. Samsung will be the owner. It will install all kind of applications without your permission from Galaxy store. You will get a hard time to update simple apps from Google Play Store like chrome, android system web view. Its better to choose a stock android mobile than any Samsung these days. The One UI is full of bloatware."

5609,4,Price drop of Rs 1000.00 after my purchase. Best value for money. 4GB RAM 128GB ROM xlnt performance. Budget phone.
5610,4,Good Device from samsung company
5611,4,Good phone for the price tag. Slightly disappointed with the quality of back cover and data cable length (too short).  Got the 128Gb model with Flipkart protection for 1year at 10500/-. Thanks to flipkart for ontime delivery!
5612,1,Overheating issue. You use for 15 mins and phone will get overheated. Very bulky you will feel like holding a brick. Battery charging will show you time of 2hours 40 mins and even after 3 to 4 hours it will be charged only 50% to 60%. Also feel like at some place touch is not working properly need to click twice. Finger print sensor also useless rating 1 star only. Poor product.
5613,5,Worth mobile
5614,2,"Not recommended! Pros 1. Big battery. 2. Moderate display. 3. Front camera.  Cons 1. Bulky and heavy. 2. Worst Back camera. 3. Didn't support wifi 5Ghz. 4. Didn't support 4G+ network. Only support 2G, 3G & 4G network. 5. Slow charging. I am very disapoint. Waste my mony. Realme, Oppo, Redmi, Poco will better choice."
5615,5,Good camera
5616,1,"Hi Once completed the payment, there is bargaining on replacement product price, that too looking very close to finding the fault, further we have paid 500 rs extra, apart from 3300 for old Mobile on exchange values. which is unhappy. even though there is no much defect on Old Mobile Product."
5617,5,Good
5618,1,Phone is bulky also front camera is worst.  Nit even guven tempered glass with mobile. Almost all companies are given the same.   So before order orser temper glass as well because tuff to have tempred in lockdown.  Also without temper glass riak of breakage.
5619,5,OK
5620,2,Wrost mobile phone in samsung brand
5621,2,Camera is not good and mobile hangs
5622,1,Camera bad quality as compared to 48 pix heavy weight please don't buy this product. Performance low
5623,4,It is perfect in this range of price.
5624,2,"Writing this review after using for 50 days. Speaker grill damage, sound is breaking. Samsung is now degarding its image as i've been coming across many cases of samsung phone where issues are been observed within 6 months. People suggested me to not buy a samsung phone but i had that trust factor but they betrayed. Hope Samsung maintains its quality and trust in People mind because word of mouth marketing has huge impact on brands"
5625,5,Display Quality is little dull type because it is not a full HD display Smartphone it's a HD . When you watching Movies or Shows You Observe the Quality of screen.And Other Features are awesome. Because of display Quality photos look like dull that we think camera is not good but actually CAMERA IS BEST
5626,5,I thought Samsung's camera quality would be very good but it is very poor. I have done a lot of stupidity by taking this mobile. It would have been better if I had taken another mobile better than this. I didn't expect this from Samsung
5627,5,Its an average phone at best price
5628,5,Perfect mobile under budget
5629,1,Don't waste your money on this.Everything s***s in this phone.if you press on call it will take 50 sec to start call if display of page is large display breaks slow performance lots of bugs in tge software no value for money.Avoid this phone
5630,5,good
5631,2,Phone is too weight. Camera is very worst.
5632,2,Always phone is hanging.. I don't save any files in my phone also
5633,1,"Worst purchase ever. The voice breaks evry other second. We cannot complete any conversation without reconnecting 3-4 times. Tried with 3 different service provider sim, and the same sim tried on different phone to compare. It proved its the phone fault. Its a complete waste of money"
5634,1,"one of biggest worst phone ever in my life, bad camera, bad picture quality, hanging problem and within a month of buying the phone is dead, so friends, do not buy this phone at all.such a bad phone that i don't have words to call it lousy."
5635,5,"Mind blowing Really happy with the product. Camera quality is awesome. Battery backup is also good. Overall, I am happy with the product."
5636,5,Nice fone
5637,5,"I am regular user of Samsung mobile instead other Chinese mobiles. Nice phone in this price segment. Its been more than 2 month buying this phone and didn't find any error. Runs smoothly! If you are planning to buy this Go for it. If you can spend a few more penny, I would suggest Samsung F22 which is newly launched :)."

5639,1,Waste of money
5640,5,Good phone
5641,1,"Speaker sound is not good Tons of pre-installed apps Only useless apps Worst software optimization & ram management I have seen in any samsung mobile Heavy ram usage by system itself 4gb ram variant is left with only 1.4 gb free ram , when the mobile is first setup  Just copied Chinese manufacturers A global leader with these nonsense"
5642,4,"Pros: 1. Good battery backup 2. UI is very good 3. Samsung knox security 4. Display is ok Cons: 1. Camera performance is just above par in suficient light, but too much noise in low light shots 2. Little bit of delay in app opening 3. Be clear, it is *NOT FOR GAMING*  Overall one of the best for normal users under 10k"
5643,5,Value for money 💰 it's camera is best battery life is awesome
5644,2,Don't buy this phone as The display is below average quality as it lacks color n clarity. The night video shooting is terrible n d zooming option too is bad The overall performance is average.the refresh rate whether it's 60 or 90 hz is worst.
5645,5,90Hz experienced as smooth as cream
5646,1,"I feel below issues after 1 day use 1. Very bad camera quality 2. Heating problem 3. Dual band wifi is not working or not available in this device 4. Hanging problem, no smooth scrolling or stuck in between use  Very bad product samsung making  You will get lots of other good phones in this price range. Think twice before buying this one."
5647,2,Gyro is not available I was really upsad for this mobile phone and also flipkart systems
5648,5,"Bought this for my mami!!! She is so happy with its looks and design. Performance & battery is out of the world, specially battery. Can't expect camera of DSLR in this price range, though sufficient for daily use."
5649,5,"I bought Galaxy F12 for Rs.7,400. So it is value for money. It was delivered in excellent condition in this lockdown condition. The customer care is also very good. Thank you Flipkart."

7234,1,Worst product ever bought will say never ever go for any mivi product  ** After 2 months of use Will say  This thing has one of the cheapest build quality  They have just a piece of cloth to cover the internal parts under the ear buds  Magnet stopped working  User experience uncomfortable to wear for more than 1 hours will feel irritation and uneasiness not at all comfortable.  My earphones stopped working connected them but the warranty claim process is so bad 1 2 week passed but I am jus...
7235,2,Really it's a very very bad product...waste of mone. When you call someone one or receive call of someone it doesn't work properly ...I mean the other person on your call can't hear you properly. But the best part is long battery life
7236,4,Good Product
7237,5,"Good product,bass is awesome,sound quality is also Good,I loved it"
7238,5,Awsm more than expected
7239,5,It is a very nice quality neckband. Sound is crystal clear. We get a premium experience. Bass is very loud and clear. Built quality is very nice. Battery backup is upto 30hrs on full charge.
7240,5,🥇 Battery backup and charging speed awesome. 🥈 Bass Sound quality and voice clarity so 👍🏻 nice. 🥉 Build quality also good at this price.
7241,1,One side earphone not working and very low sound another one side this problem on first day
7242,3,I don't like the sound quality . I expected much more than this from mivi but i don't feel bass also and the volume is also not good. It should be upto a level but unfortunately it wasn't. The magnet is also not good. That's why i am returning this product
7243,5,Awesome product
7244,5,Love this..🔥🔥
7245,2,Product is not as expected...
7246,2,Honest review !!!!  battery backup is good There is no bass only Sound quality is poor Not as loud its should be And there is no mivi logo on battery compartment As it's shown in the images Magnets are below average Feels cheap My old Samsung wired earphones which costs only 400 rupees sound better then these  Mivi disspointed me Worst neckband ever that I've tried Plz look out other neckbands
7247,2,My left ear piece is making crackle noise other than that sound quality is good 1.Bass is ok not for bass lovers 2.Mid's is best for the price. 3.Best performance is at 60 to 70 % of volume above that music gets a bit rough 4.Best in quality . 5.only for melody songs. Returned only for that crackle noise from Left ear piece
7248,1,"Its very bd sound quality , too long wire , plastic quality also bad"

7979,5,Good product I like it thanks Flipkart
7980,5,1. Material Quality - Not Bad... 2. Sound Quality - Awesome... 3. Bass - Decent Quality... 4. Battery Backup - Very Good... 5. Design & Bulid Quality - Very nice... 6. Fitting - Oky Type... Overall very nice and Velue for money product... Really i love the product...🤩
7981,5,"Writing this review after using more than 15 days. 255F pro+ has super sound quality. Bass is decent and fair enough. Most important highlight of this headset is battery life,it's amazing. Runtime depends on usage but definitely it will give you more than any other headset. Should go for it."
7982,5,One of the best Bluetooth Boat. 1- Battery Backup Amazing 2- light wait 3-Awesome Sound quality 4-Bass good 5- Design normal but good not best
7983,5,Nice product and fast delivery . I am happy nice job Flipkart thanks
7984,4,"Delivered in 20 February.. today is 28 February and i didn't charge it till now still battery percentage is 70%.. i use it daily for online classes, 1 movie and 3 hours For music approx 9-10 hours daily so Battery is very Powerfull.it's housing is made by plastic and neck wire of somewhat soft silicone material cable is flat long and strong enough..Bass is above the best if you use right size of ear buds..even in 90% volume vocals are crystal clear treble is well balanced..Call quality is far..."
7985,5,"Great product., battery backup up to 14 days use , sound quality is great , I am happy with the product 😊😊😊😊"
7986,4,This product is acctullly best. best coloty and design. But sound is little low not bed its a perfect but little low. bass is very powerful and clear. battery backup is very best in this price range. definately you purchase this product.
7987,4,"Just got my hands on this product. Let me be honest. Build quality pretty good. Everything fine no cracks or openings. Now the most important point - Bass. I have seen many people and many YouTubers telling that bass is bit much. For for me it is pretty well balanced and works out pretty well. I cannot tell much about battery backup. Let me use this for a couple of days. Then I will update my post. Sound quality also good and if you are used to listening to high volume of sound, you can easil..."
7988,5,Battery backup is best and full charge very quickly. Sound quality is best .I love it. You can buy it without any hesitation.
7989,5,"Rockerz 255pro+ is excellent and value for money product by Boat.Battery backup is also outstanding, build,sound quality and performance also mind blowing.I am really happy with this neckband also it is comfortable for ears."
7990,4,This neckband looks good for its price especially for the battery backup and fast charging. Sound is good but bass could have been more and better. Have to use and check more for better opinion. Call quality is good though... Cons are that it doesn't fit that well into the ears and right side feels little heavy cos of remote buttons on the right cable.
7991,5,As compared to any other company models and even boat most famous model this is the best product. With a dedicated mic and enormous battery backup. I don't suppose any other blutooth headset can compete with this. I have tried and tested with my office calls and response was amazing. Due to to Covid situation Work from home this product is the best support. It connects with my Laptop and mobile at the same time. And I can easily switch between concalls and online calls work great throughout ...
7992,5,"I am writing this review after using it for 4 months. Product material is very poor quality. 2 times broken without doing anything. Plastic quality is very very poor. If you are looking for Better product so please don't buy it. Sound Quality and battery life is amazing but Product material is very wrost. I can say, This is a best Neckband I have ever seen. I got this product on 16 August evening & I used this Neckband till now continuously but it showing 20% battery. Actually I was confused..."
7993,5,Nice base and sound quality enjoyable ☺️ I prefer it's good battery back up is so nice 😉 nice product from boat and filpcart 💪👍
7994,5,"The battery life is really amazing, on average use of 4-5 hrs per day it lasts upto 5-6 days on 50-60% volume. Also the fast charging really works, you will get 10hrs battery backup with 10 minutes of charge, whereas it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge which is good. The mic does have noise cancellation and quality of voice over mic is very good. The build quality is also nice, it feels durable and the fit is good and snuggly.  My opinion:- Its the best bluetooth collar band in this price segme..."
7995,5,This review is written after 1 month use ; 1. Battery life is really amazing 2. Great sound and Base quality 3. Perfectly fit in the ear 4. The MIC does have noise cancelation 5. Quality of voice over MIC is very good 6. Battery backup is really amazing  Excellent product. ! No other brands can challenge the boat. It's the beat bluetooth go for it without any doubt
7996,5,"Excellent product. ! Very good Sound/Bass quality, nd battery backup is amazing 🤗.. No other brands can challenge the Boat. Earlier Sony was good, but ever since the boat came, it became everyone's best choice."
7997,1,"Its only 7 months I bought this product. It was convenient for me to use. Sound,Bass everything is good but. It said it has water & sweat resistance power. I never worked out wearing these not splashed any water but still one side stopped working in 1 second without any warning. I feel like I wasted my money in this. Wired earphones work longer than this."
7998,4,Awesome battery backup And Great Sound quality . Perfectly fits in the ear. What else you need. Thanks to bOAT & FLIPKART both for this Wonderful Product.
7999,3,bass is good 4/5 battery life is awesome 5/5 built quality is ok ok 3.5/5 dual connectivity working ok 3.5/5 mic is also good 4/5 its value for money yes but but there is a issue while playing vedio on youtube or vedioplayer if you fast forward voice get disrupted for few second and that's very annoying thats why giving 3 /5
8000,4,For battery I could give 10 star if possible......pvc plastic is just okay. But voice on calling is crystal clear because of cvc technology. Earlier my wife always complain about my voice when I was using other Bluetooth earphone while calling but now she is happy and me too........ Don't take it otherwise I work out of station ....lol
8001,4,Base is not good but volume is so loud 🙂 Treble are good also Battery life is ultimate awesome 😍 Overall Best neckband
8002,4,14/2/2021 I ordered it it arrived after 2 day's it was my first bluetooth neckband it's bass and battery lifle is awesome over all sound 3.5-4 /5 but now after around 3 months it's one side (left ear) is not working properly for the last few days . It's in warenty so I will update this review after I get touch with boat's customer service .
8003,5,Nice 👍 everything is good
8004,4,"I got this product on 5th oct 2021 , today is 15th october 2021.Iam using this product now with out charging from delivery day... The batterry backup is owsom  Sound quality amd bass are verry nice and morethan worth for your money... But build quality is not pretty good. But it is also value for money in this range...  The magnetic lock is not perfect... Magnetic power is little lower. Some features are miss in this headphone ...like in oneplus headphones.. That is automatically off when we..."
8005,5,Good Product long lasting battery But when i compare it with my Infinity glide 120 the sound and bass are better there alas the its battery is only 6hrs so if you need good voice with better build quality with less battery go with glide 120 but if you.need A little less audio not much just a little and way long lasting battery go with this one
8006,5,Best product below 2k. Sound quality is amazing. Its like a home theatre inside my ears. Battery is excellent. No issue with the buttons. Range is also good. But the ear buds are not comfortable becoz my earholes are too small even the small bud is not working for me. Other than that its a good one. I will update after 1 month.
8007,4,"Reviewing after using for 1 month.  Sound quality: Average sound quality. Bass boosted but sound quality degrades in lower frequencies.  Loudness: Pretty loud. 25% volume is loud enough for indoors listening. Hardly used over 50% volume.  Noise isolation: Decent.  Fit: Excellent.  Battery: Hats off. Charge it, forget it.  Connectivity: Excellent. Signal drops rarely even after 2 walls.  Mic: No complaints.  Built quality: Below average. Pretty sure the charging port is going to break first. C..."
8008,5,Battery backup is awesome Sound & Bass are very good Noise cancellation is working fine & you find it clearly while travelling If you are games lover don't go for it
8009,3,It was a worthy purchase at the price tag of 1200. Good sound and bass.. Mic is very average as it's not noise cancelling.. The build quality is very poor and have zero premium feel...it feels like I bought a road side brand.. battery backup us awesome.. Over all a decent budget earphone..
8010,4,After using for more than 10 days I am writing this review... 1. Sound is okay nothing great 2. Noise cancellation is not good atall the other person can hear lots of disturbance in call 3. Battery is long lasting I used for total 12 days after one complete charge and I use it daily for atleast 5-6 hours for official calls. Secondly it takes less then an hour for 100% charge... 4. Boat has to work more on sound quality on bluetooth devices as their wired headphones has par quality then this....
8011,5,Nycc product reasonable rate All are well and good Battery backup is also good Nice in colour All is well about this
8012,5,Thank you flipkart for best deal I got this for 1299 and earphone is amazing .. sound quality is great and charging is also great.. if anyone is searching earphone for wireless earphone with budget 1500 you can go for this .. trust me it's a best deal .
8013,5,"Its a best option for 1500 budget value people, its best headphones ever i purchase, it's bass is like ""ooo maa gu turu lob"".such a amazing headphones"
8014,4,Every thing is just awesome but build quality of boat products as usual sucks... If handled carefully can last about 1 yr or more but not then it can't survive Only go for it if u r not a rough user By seeing its quality i can say its more durable than its 225 nd 255 pro version but not as durable as realme dizo neckands. So if a heavy user i suggest go for realme Or if u get this at below 1200(in sale/offer ) Then only go for it Other than that i am extremely happy with its mic and s...
8015,5,"Just got the package ☺️ And Unboxed it and just Sayed wow the packaging style of boat is superb and the sound is also very good , Bass is also very Good and design is also killing 🔥 But the main problem is in fittings but it doesn't matter I just want a monster battery life I got my package on 11 Oct.

8020,5,"It's awesome product, i received original boat earphone in good condition and good quality..  Nice sound quality Nice bass quality And awesome battery backup.. Its value for money"
8021,4,"I have oneplus base edition too and that's darn better than it in sound clarity and design, it's design is not for those who wear it while sleeping and also not comfortable to wear for a long but oneplus one is really a better option than this because of its body softness and in ear experience,yeah sound quality too."
8022,5,I bought in big billion days I was confused it and 235v2 then bought this totally super product battery packup is awesome bass is very nice really good just go for it...
8023,5,"The best so far. Battery beast and bass will be better than many similar products ( use suitable bud)  Friends and relatives who tried once got addicted instantly and asked me to order. Out of stock everywhere. Once it comes to stock, just but without any hesitations. Useful for workouts too. Design and style are awesome. Build quality is lesser when compared to other boat models"
8024,5,Such a nice product please buy it . This sound is awesome.this model also very nice and this battery backup 40 hours very nice product . Thank you Flipkart
8025,5,This is the best Bluetooth earphone for all Battery backup excellent and support fast charging Sound and bass is superb
8026,4,It’s amazing product and worth for money. It’s sound quality is good and comfort in use. I would prefer to buy this product.
8027,4,"Awesome battery backup, sound quality is average. I prefer it as a good bluetooth headset and excellent battery backup at this price range"
8028,5,Superb blutooth. Best part is their sound quality. And it has huge battery backup which makes it more worth it.
8029,5,"Lot of confusions before buying, whether to buy neckband or airdopes. At last i settled with Boat neckband. Already using Boat headphones & speakers so i believed in sound quality & clarity. Really best neckband at this price point. Sound is soo clear, enjoying music with clear & quality bass. Battery backup is soo good, came 100% charged and still 97% Overall its a good quality product. Go for it guys."
8030,5,This product is really amazing its sound quality is very good compared to others and most important battry backup is really satisfied
8031,5,Excellent product earlier i was too confuse should i buy or not but finally I had made a decision to buy because currently I'm using boat 402 which is excellent in term of everything but mine friend like neck band that's why i had order this one for him. friend if you like neck bands then go for this or if you like wireless then you should prefer boat 402 hope this will help you to choose correct products
8032,3,"Not recommended because of desine failure. Build quality is very poor. Not comfortable to wear for long. Can't use inside helmet otherwise it will pain like hell. Good battery life is the only merit. Not fot inside ears even with the smallest pad option, ocationally poping out of ear and wearing long time it will make the ears swell from inside. So I won't recommend to anyone. Earpod design is the best for ear comfort. If you get any other head band with apple earbuds design go for it."
8033,5,"This one has been value for money. Was skeptical to buy or with no reviews, but worth it.  PROs 1. The bass and effects are too good. Typical boAt. 2. The battery backup too sustains for 8+ hours continuous usage. 3. Microphone pickup is very good. Noise cancellation does not work that well. But very good for calls and meetings. 4. Length of cable to ear is long enough to keep microphone and controls easily accessible. 5. Very Light Weight.  CONs 1. The build quality is something that I di..."

8054,5,"Was using Bullets z, 255F pro sounds is louder than bullets and provides thumping base. The only complain I have is the design and build quality. The band doesn't wrap around neck since the plastic is a bit hard, therefore not very good for people who wants to use it especially for running or jogging, although for those who wants to use it while wearing helmet for driving, it's a good choice.  30 hours minimum backup no matter how and at what volume you use it.  In short it's a good deal for ..."

Battery Backup is also upto the mark; it's almost a week with moderate use and the battery level is still 50% But the look and the quality of material is objectionable as it doesn't look premium and the colour is also very much different from the one which is shown in display. But overall performance is good.

And it is really unexpected from boat.. Go for other earphones"
8168,1,Not working after 1.5month 😔

10516,3,After using this almost 2 months I just says it's a good smart band battery will work for 5 to 6 days and most importantly its just a piece of digital watch. So if you really want to buy a smart watch plz get somethg else. Good thing in this id the trackers works almost correct.
10517,2,"Dizo application is totally useless. It disconnect the watch every time you minimise the app. So pathetic. Battery lasts about 4 days. Not good enough. But one thing, the watch looks premium and stylish 👍. That’s the only thing I like so much."
10518,5,"It will perform more than you accept🔥, I am getting nearly 10 days on one charge keeping brightness to min and it charges in 2 hours. Also. Getting all the usefull features and a big screen along with very smooth touch. Taking about the Build:- It is solid as I have dropped it multiple times and it has not got any single scratch on it.  Overall Good Product."
10519,3,Used for three days… Pros.. Averge battery life Conz…. Display is averge quality dont expect near to amoled Build quality average Raise to wake response is very bad … so much lag Sensor quality is not that much aacurate Overall… Just a showcase smart watch dont buy it .. if you need an accurate and good display one.
10520,3,"Liked the watch as worthy ☺️ But small small unsatisfieds Like * can't mute & attend phone calls, * Tap to wake is not in this, * Battery life is not that much but okay.... Other qualities r good"
10521,5,"At this price range you cannot get more than this provides you each n every necessary features that a smart watch should have. Purchased after watching many videos and found that this watch is the best for watch in this price range. Touch is very smooth, no lagging display is amazing. I bought pink strap which indeed looks super stylish.. very happy"
10522,5,Nice watch
10523,2,Wake gesture is not working properly
10524,5,Nice watch
10525,4,"Pretty Handy as compared to all smart watches in this segment,U should go for it Only one con:- It's bit bulgy and heavy in weight Hope u fetch my review and approve by buying the same Adios nd Cuidate."
10526,4,The watch is fantastic. The only thing is.. when you walk or cycle it will just show you the stats but no gps. Even mi band has gps at least in its application. But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that. Further the activity modes are different but the way it tracks a certain activity is same. For cycling for walking for running.. it shows the same UI The music controls doesn't show the title of the music playing. It just has the basic music controls.  Apart from thes...
10527,4,Impressed.

10589,5,Nice product satisfied for any customer screen is big and attractive
10590,5,Excellent
10591,5,In this price it a very nice product. I checked in water also. Most of it is a very value for money product. The response of this product is a little bit slow but it can be ignore. The SpO2 measure system also not bad some times 1 or 2% errors are there. The Dizo App helps to connect with the device. But it takes all the permissions for run it. So before connecting with the mobile check the terms and conditions.
10592,2,"First time when I ordered my dizo watch 2 it shows heart rates and blood oxygen level on dead objects, then I replaced my watch and same issue appear. Note: If you want to show off then only go for this watch. PROs:- 1)LOOKS 2)LOOKS 3)LOOKS CONs:- 1) This watch shows heart rates and blood oxygen level of dead objects. #FakeSensors #Magic 2) After installing this Dizo app my mobile getting laggy. 3) Even on DND mode my watch shows notifications. 4) This watch takes more time to raise to wake...."
10593,4,Excellent 👌
10594,5,Good
10595,1,This watch got charging issue this watch charger not working probably

10621,4,Nice product for value of money good battery pack up sutable for all men and women disply quality is awesome
10622,3,"The UI is a bit slow, but good in this section of price tag, rest the magnetic charger is pro point, activity tracker is a bit inaccurate sometimes, rest of you're looking for something good in this budget, this is what you need. Better than Boat and Firebolt in this section."
10623,5,Great product
10624,5,Very nice...
10625,5,Awesome watch in reasonable price 🙂
10626,3,I am giving 3 star just because mute calls facility is not there. Overall the product is very good. Dizo should add the mute calls facility to this watch.

10743,5,Nice smart watch this price 👍🏻
10744,2,Not Good

10750,5,Everything is good its an amazing product
10751,2,Not very good. But ok for price.
10752,2,"⭐Design is good. ⭐ BATTERY is good But I bought the watch because of functional features like SPO2 , BPM, Steps. But data is not correct. It's showing sleep data, even I did not wear it while sleeping.  That's why 2 star only."
10753,5,Good
10754,2,Display gets scratches easily ....then it looks bad .. Please consider it while buying
10755,4,Nice
10756,2,poor battery backup
10757,2,Raise to wake features not working properly.....power switch also very bad....😔
10758,5,"Good watch , quality is very good ,value for money 💰and this is the best watch under 2000"
10759,1,Warst watch
10760,1,Overrated. Third Quality device. Not any proper function working in application. Only numbers not name display in Display when call received.
10761,2,Watch is good but connection rang is very low
10762,4,I had purchased it around three weeks ago and i found it very attractive and super as far as design and activities tracking are concerned. Just one issue i found is its raise to wake sensor sometimes didn't work properly.
10763,1,"Looks is premium but the activity tracker doesn't work properly, I mean whenever you move your hand or wrist it counts some steps, which really irritates me, apart from this watch is ok"
10764,1,It is buggy watch ....Hand wake up is not working properly .. And too much heavy on hand waste of money .. Please don't pichde.
10765,1,Very bad experience I am writing this after 1 and a half month all the sensors have become non responding not a single sensor is working.
10766,1,Worst app ever. Absolutely no detailed reports. Very basic analysis. Only plus is big screen. Needs to work on improving app. Connection between phone n watch is erratic. Takes 2 seconds to display time on wrist flick. Big lag. Total mood off. Regret buying it.
10767,1,Touch not working after 2 days
10768,1,"Does not synchronise with earlier version of RealMe Link App, the DIZO app is extremely basic, not worth it, wait save and buy a better product"
10769,5,Mind blowing watch...All bugs are are fix in update... Definately you can purchase it.
10770,3,Good smartwatch in this price range but some features are not working properly.
10771,3,Tracking system is very Bad But looking awesome
10772,3,Good
10773,2,Nothing to say about this watch. Simply mind blowing. All the colours are beautiful. Just need improvements in the app as lag issue is there and few bugs too.  After 10 days. Colour Fade issue within 10 days.
10774,1,So bad looking 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮
10775,1,Battery ⚡ vere bad one 5days battery pavar
10776,4,Nice watch in this price range but always on display is missing in this watch
10777,5,"At this price range you cannot get more than this provides you each n every necessary features that a smart watch should have. Purchased after watching many videos and found that this watch is the best for watch in this price range. Touch is very smooth, no lagging display is amazing.

13978,4,"I'm writing this review after 48hrs of use. I'm not promoting the sale of company. This is the honest one I'm writing which I found after the use.  pros:- 1. Heart rate & spo2 sensor are 85%-90% accurate(improvement needed 2. By switch into a sports mode it can give a better result if the watch is connected to your phone and your phone gps is on. 3. sleep tracking is also good but can be better by improving the algorithm & software. its 75% accurate. 4. Built quality, colour saturation is up ..."

13985,5,The watch is really ver very nice one. Go for it without any hesitation. It's really an amazing smart watch. Its working properly with realme link aap and also shows the correct results. It runs for about 10 to 12 days on a single charge. I love this watch. Most importantly it's waterproof. 👍👍👍
13986,5,First time user of smart watch. Amazing felling and also activity tracker is just awesome. Accuracy is also satisfactory level. Go for it guys...
13987,5,"I recently purchased this newly launched realme Watch 2 from flipkart. This is my first smart watch and I am very excited to use it. After using it for a while now, I can say that this is the best budget smartwatch from realme. It fits very well in my wrist and looks very stylish. All of its features works perfectly and it is very useful gadget. I am very happy with the over all build quality and performance of this realme Watch 2. Thanks flipkart for super fast delivery as always."
13988,2,The product is not worth. It's cheap plastic. Activity tracking is not accurate. SPO2 readings are not accurate. Only display is bright and battery seems to fine. Casing is made cheap plastic. Not worth. I should have gone with Noise Fit.

14034,1,"The display is good, and the UI is smooth as well. There are a tons of features, but activity tracking is completely inaccurate. The step count is totally wrong and also the calories count doesn’t add up. Heart rate and SpO2 isn’t accurate either. Also in most of the product images, it looks like the blacks are deep so the thick bezels won’t bother, but in person it’s completely opposite. Overall, not happy. It’s just gimmicky product.

14049,2,"Talking honestly, I have purchased many products from flipkart and for the first time I am unsatisfied. I always do complete research before buying any product by reading specifications and reviews. This product, realme Watch 2 is completely a waste of money. I bought it for activity tracking and it is so inaccurate that it is showing my SpO2 level of 75% to 80% every time. Also, it tracked only 84 steps even when I walked 200 steps by counting.

14115,1,Very bad product
14116,1,Batter performance is poor..... 1 day only
14117,1,Not good
14118,1,"WORST BATTERY BACK UP NOT STANDS EVEN 24 HS WHY FLIP CART&SELLER CHEATING CUST? WILL FLIPKART REFUND/REFUND ? BUT KNOW -AFTER SALES RESPONSE IS NOT CULTURE OF FLIP CART,FLIP CART HAVING ONLY ONE POLICY- USE &THROW CUST, FLIP CART RISE. ABOVE THIS BLACK REPUTATION?"

14123,5,Super smart watch 💞. Thank you
14124,4,Display brightness and colors are excellent but the display size is not that good it is small tracking and all is okay but price is much higher it should be under 2500-3000
14125,5,Superb watch nice quality battery backup good
14126,1,"This is highly inaccurate in activity tracking management. We can expect maximum 20% error in activity tracking, but this watch is almost 60% inaccurate. I have compared results multiple times, everytime it makes me upset. I have purchased it for my cycling activity. I ride 15 km and it shows only 6 km. (After using mobile gps as well). Realme only good in marketing and for his paid reviews in YouTube."

14141,5,"This watch is ok to those who wants to buy smart watch. Pros Good battery back up. Accuracy is upto mark. No lagging so far.  Cons While walking with outdoor walk mode, diatance not getting calculated. It happens often. GPS gets disconnected oftenly Your app needs to be more easier user friendly."

14154,1,"Step counts are just for sake, you shake your hand and it counts it as a step. Most of the time display lags to wakeup and notifications are sometimes received and sometimes not. Still do not receive notifications for many applications even after allowing in the application. Standup is always on, after 1 week sleep monitor stopped working"

14162,2,"Talking honestly, I have purchased many products from flipkart and for the first time I am unsatisfied. I always do complete research before buying any product by reading specifications and reviews. This product, realme Watch 2 is completely a waste of money. I bought it for activity tracking and it is so inaccurate that it is showing my SpO2 level of 75% to 80% every time. Also, it tracked only 84 steps even when I walked 200 steps by counting. It shows constant heart beat of 72 to 85 wheth..."

14761,3,Writing after 4 days use. Just so-so and battery claim of 12 days by company is nothing more than a bluff hardly ran for three days. Step tracking is not accurate even start counting while riding and driving..  In gym I used it's workout mode and after 15 minutes it got hanged.  Expectations was so high while purchasing after seeing review and advertising but not fit to my perception..  It could have been more better...  Can't say wastage of money but even not value for maney.  3500 bucks are...
14762,5,Avarage
14763,5,Fabulous product...touch response is really good
14764,5,Over all Good experience
14765,3,"The watch by itself is all good. Battery life, Build, Display, everything is spot on, even the app is all nice but there is issue with Bluetooth connectivity. Even when the phone is connected and receiving notifications, still the app will show *sync failure*. I either have to restart the watch or restart bluetooth on my phone for a fix. This is a bit annoying. This happens if the watch remains un-connected with the phone for a long time and then we try to connect back. It's not seamless. Sin..."

16805,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode

16810,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
16811,4,Best in price segment. If you have skill this entry level dslr can do much better result. Just Dont expect much.

16813,5,"I am yet to use it to full extent. Used it mildly and it exceeds expectation. Pros : Battery life, rugged body, splash proof, fast, better connectivity options (NFC, Wifi), Fast memory card support, Touch screen - Easy controls. Cons : I felt only cons was its weight but this can be ignored as went hiking with this and even my water bottle felt heavy. And it has crop sensor so if upgrading lens need to check carefully. A lens that works on full frame gives different result on crop (more mag..."

16839,4,"Nice product,I got it within 5 days as promised.only issue is with card.on the box it's mentioned that it will come with a 16 GB memory card and I was also told a camera bag would also be delivered along with.it's been 15 days and I have yet to receive the camera bag."
16840,5,This is my second DSLR. previously i used canon 700d. This is simply superb. Having wifi and nfc are the best benefits. I noticed that the picture come out from 700d looks some what artificial.

16849,5,"After research and contemplating a compact 100D, I decided with this. Although this is heavy, it is quite well built and one can manage a photo shoot with 70-200L lens on it. Upgrading from a 1000D, this is a blessing. :)"

16922,5,Nice one
16923,5,Best home router in this price point. signal range is pretty good . satisfied with the product.
16924,4,"Honest review 1. Flipkart service great as always. Packing was okay (instead of wrapping in bubble wrap it was wrapped in small piece of carton due to which box got little damaged) but delivery time was excellent. Delivered in 2 days. 2. Router build quality is okay. As many customers already told about gloss finish easily gets scratched So, I won't get into that details and for me a router looks is not important, its functions are. 3. For those who don't know about 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz dual ban..."
16925,1,"Hi Everyone,  So let's talk about D-Link 819 router. below all comments i personally experience that's way i am sharing with you all Flipkart buyer's and lovers 😀  1. D-Link 819 it's a dual band router 2.4 and 5 but the thing is for longer distances 5 gigahertz range not connected. 2.4 gigahertz range covered maximum 1.5bhk room not more than that.  2. As i buy this product for better performance and better experience of wifi range but D-Link 819 router not that much satisfied personally t..."
16926,1,I don't know what people are liking about this product but to my experience what i can say is this product is just a piece of trash. Unusable. I have a 100 Mbps internet connection. And before this router i was using a TP Link singal band router. The signal of that router was so strong i could use that from the street ( I'm not kidding here). But due to some short-circuit the router got fried and i looked for a dual band router. And I got this. My experience with this router is horrible. I g...
16927,5,"Since last 10 years I was using the net gear n150 which is my first router. As my fire stick was not giving good performance with net gear. I planned to go for this one as this is a dual band supports 5 GHz.  After connecting this beauty, I realised net gear has done its job & this is a beast of a router which is giving me a unparalleled & no loss connectivity at both 2.4 & 5 GHz range.  Just go for it. I love this product."
16928,5,Best wifi router in this price segment. Solid build quality. Great connectivity. No connection drops. 5Ghz speeds are great but range is low as expected with 5Ghz band. 2.4Ghz range is good. Prefect for a medium home.
16929,4,"Best Router at This Price, Satisfy With Both The Network; Pros: 2.4 and 5 Ghz Both Working Extremely Well... Go For This For Dual Band, Worth Product. Cons: Firmware is very weird, no global update and fixes... Even couldn't support bandwith limit."
16930,2,"GENUINE REVIEW AFTER USING A MONTH...... >If you are buying this router considering dual bandwidth thn forget it and buy a cheaper one coz the range of 5ghz band is only 3 meters thats it. >If you have a 2bhk and you installed the router in hall thn 5ghz network will not reach master bedroom or any corner of house which is covered with many obstacles such as walls, almirah , washroom and so. >Only 2.4ghz band range will cover your whole house except the congested corners and washrooms. >O..."
16931,4,Aswm Router In this range..this Router in 2 options.. 5g Router.... Available in(2g/3g/4g) and best version is 5g.. Continue use cooling system. Good Router I am satisfied.. 😊😊
16932,5,outstanding product must buy it no drops in internet and the router range is very good when I reach out of my home I am getting signals 150 meters away from routers it has high gain antennas
16933,4,"A very good product for normal to heavy user. I use it for my smart tv and for playing pubg in my smartphone, it works awesome with my siti broadband."
16934,4,Product is good but delivery was too late.
16935,5,Very nice product ...
16936,3,speed is good but range is not good as i expected over all it is good for that price
16937,4,"OK. I had searched for so many answers but didn't get it all answered even after going through all the reviews. Anyways bought this Dir819 unit in Aug 2019. I'll try to answer all questions I was looking for, maybe it'll hep others. Also I went for this model specifically since it had both 2.4Ghz (more penetration thru walls) and 5Ghz (higher speed) antennas 1) I primarily wanted this as a repeater to my main Keralavision broadband internet which was connected to a huawei wifi router (built i..."
16938,1,Something wrong with router.Wifi gets disconnected automatically. Tried resetting but that also doesn't work. First time facing issue with Dlink. Even Not able to find this product on Official Dlink site for firmware upgrade.Similar product is there but not this Model.  Is this a real Dlink product?
16939,1,Had configuration issue while using every time i switch on the power button.will not recommend this product
16940,1,After Seeing the Positive Review I purchased the Router But It Turnout a Nightmare. I Call My Technician To Installation Of Router But Due It's Hardware Issue it can't able to save changes of my ISP To the Dlink Router. He tried Very Hard But Due to Manufacturing Defective Piece He was Unable To Save Changes In The Router. My 1500 Rs Goes In Vain As The Flipkart Refuses To Replacement Of My Product. Never Purchase A DLink Router Of Any Model From Flipkart. They Cheat The Customer. GO For TP ...
16941,2,"This Product seems not listed under the D-link India site . So can't see any firmware updates related files etc . More over , the Web ( internet ) LED always blinks ""GREEN"" whether internet is there or not . ( whereas I have TP-Link router , which shows Amber light when Internet is not available and same ED turn ""GREEN"" when internet is up. ) So it is very difficult to check the ""Net"" status by looking at LED light."
16942,3,"It is a very good router. The range is good for 2.4 GHz. The 5 GHz have a low range but it is normal with 5 GHz. The only problem I found out is that if we are using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz at same time on different devices, the one with 5 GHz isn't fast enough i.e. the bandwidth distribution between both the bands doesn't seem equal. Otherwise it is a great product for its price."
16943,1,"I dont know if its only for my case. But after a month of use this router is not working properly. Internet is not accessible, alway shows no internet on both my laptop and mobile thought my ethernet connection is absolutely working fine. After turning on 5min and it stops giving internet access.. really bad experience with this product."
16944,1,"not working properly,my service provider had said that product is not of good quality"
16945,5,"The setup was very easy and quick. Even the delivery was pretty quick, it got delivered within 12 hrs of placing the order. The range is pretty good. Definitely worth every penny spent on it."
16946,1,"Pathetic Service from the seller and Flipkart. Product was damaged, return request not accepted for no reason - pathetic response by Flipkart customer care team and it's a total loss of money for me. Just don't buy this product."
16947,1,There is a connectivity issue when power goes on/off need to reset the router done the all configuration then it will be worked
16948,1,its a fake dlink .. 5ghz range is tooo short and doesnt gives a proper speed . the model number dir819 is not mentioned in the official site also .. no dlink print on the router .. ..just a waste of time with money
16949,1,"Coverage is extremely low, one should not buy this router."
16950,5,"Good product, easy installation, 5ghz range low, because its use for only High speed,2ghz speed good and range also be good. It has Repeater mode,that very nice... There are many more settings on the web GUI, ."
16951,1,"signal coverage is bad, wastage of money."
16952,5,Very good router. 2.4ghz range is better than tplink c60.5ghz working fine for my firestick.Overall very option at this price. I bought in 999
16953,5,"Amazing router lovely working no disturb I am very very happy I use wi fi connection and brought many products from flipkart I love very much flipkart,s all product happy holly flipkart thank s slot"
16954,5,Very much satisfied with this project. The two types of bandwidth 2.4 & 5.0 GHz are additional advantage. But only 2.4 GHz is mostly used. Setting is very easy. Plug and play software is easy to operate and setting. Range is good enough across the 2 BHK home. Speed loss and packet loss is zero.
16955,5,"about the design - it is quiet good nice finish. speed - it's too good. work smooth, security settings is strong, you can mange and control the connecting speed and many more, just value for money"
16956,3,The product is nice very lite feels cheap plastic and very fragile.the signal strength is very good and the speed its giving is also good but the setting not that easy you have do a lot of setting to properly setup like dns and security protocols of tkip and ies something took me time most of the router came with setting already but not this i got it for 995 so it is a steal a deal for me
16957,5,For those who are using cable broadband this router is very good. The 5ghz band although has short range but blazing speed. If you are using 100mbps plan and still getting 5-6 mbps then its time to switch to this router to get full potential of your internet. I am having 80mbps plan with my age old router i was getting 6mbps max now i am getting 9.2mbps at all times. Pretty good router.
16958,1,"The only thing that was ok in this experience was the timely delivery. The product (D-Link DIR-819 750 Mbps Router) worked ok for just a week and after that, it stops working every 1-2 days. Every time it stops working, it has to factory reset to make it work again, but only to stop working after just a day.  It looks to me that the seller (RetailNet) has obtained some 2nd quality/refurbished pieces of this product is hence offering them at a discount from the market price. PLEASE DO NOT GET..."
16959,1,Worst.. everytime electricity goes off i have reset it.. and follow all the configuration procedure again.. this happens everytime electricity goes off or even switch off the power button.. what rubbish..
16960,4,Nice one if you need a speed upto 100mbps otherwise go for a gigabit router if want 100mbps+ speeds.Overall the product is nice and works just fine.
16961,5,Product is awesome and thankful for Flipkart helpful in covid19 time. Delivery Executive very much Polite and product get before date of delivery.
16962,4,"Nice router with dual band. Sometimes I have trouble with 5GHz. It disconnects while gaming, not sure if it's a problem with my device or with the router. However it works pretty well even in noisy environments. ( We have 20-30 router signals in 2.4Ghz range near our house still works fine.)"
16963,4,Delivered timely. Its easy to setup. The range of 2.4 Ghz is quite good around 30 feet. While 5 Ghz range is not so quite good around 12-15 feet. Overall in this price range it's a good choice.
16964,4,working perfectly good product and on time delivery by Flipkart..it works on both 2.5gh and 5gh covers good range
16965,2,Works ok. With 3 antennas the range is still pathetic. Not worth buying instead go fo TPLink which servers better in terms of Wi-Fi range.
16966,5,thank you very very flipkart and dlink for this kind of product.........my service provider told me I got a decent product in low price......the range is very very good both 2.4ghz and 5ghz.........
16967,5,Im writing this after using of 3days.so as of now its working fine.good router with dual band in budget. And most important router range is good enough for private use.Im getting full signal with in 100 feet range.
16968,3,"Range is not the best, it's decent compared to other routers, but when compared to Mi 4c router it doesn't stand a chance when it comes to range. Not only that, the mi 4c comes with a great app to control everything and a great interface too, but D-Link doesn't have any app and the interface is very generic. 5ghz band is great, really impressed with the extra speed I get out of the same network. On the 2.4 GHz the bandwidth goes upto 5MB/s at best, but on the 5GHz band it goes up to 8MB/s. th..."
16969,5,The configuration is so easy less than 2 mints to configure. router was so good with very high speed internet from 5G band and a good range. Thanks Dlink for making an excellent product. Thanks Flipkart for making it available in our location and delivering the product with plastic free mission.❤️
16970,4,"First off this was delivered within 2 days thanks to Flipkart, setup is quite easy, two seperate frequency, 5ghz is not good for my laptop or smart tv which are 5 meters away (no wall) from router with lags and buffering on 100mbps BB connection. Switched them to 2.5ghz and all is good. Now using my phone and tablet devices on 5ghz which is working fine without any buffering or lags."
16971,1,"Please make sure to check the internt port support speed as this router will only support speed upto 100mbps even if your internet speed is more than that. DLINK team, please do a better job in displaying the correct information for the customers so they choos3 the right product. Even if the router supports spped of 750mbps what is the use if the unput it takes only supports 100mbps. ????. This was waste of money as i came to know about this recently when i reached out to dlink via customer ..."
16972,5,"Highly recommended - I get the actual constant speed whatever internet plan I've. If you want speed upto 100 MBPS which is max for this router, without any doubt go and buy this one for amazing and long lasting experience. I purchased it 3 months ago and can't complain for any scenario because this is the best one. Also thanks to flipkart for their amazing service even flipkart is only one who cares about their customers by working on the feedback."
16973,1,The devices resets often and the connection will be lost in middle of work.... and the frequency is very less which doesn’t accommodate a normal connectivity even in 30x40 size home with rooms
16974,1,It is fast enough when you stay near router. Range is not good. Very frequent disconnections. Cant get enough range in a bed room of 900 sft house when router is in hall.
16975,4,"This is a fairly good router if you are just looking for very good 2.4GHz connectivity. Haven't faced any significant issues or connection drops over the last 9 months of usage. That said, this is a router that isn't perfect in many ways. It's a very old device that's modified for Indian market recently. The firmware update file can't be found in the mail D-Link site, but only in the Indian D-Link site. Also, a big drawback for me personally, was just 2 DDNS providers (dlinkddns,dyndns), o..."
16976,3,"The router os good however giving 3 star because this doesnt come with manage via application, moreover Dlink official app doesnt support the model number Dir819, better to go for a router that dlink app supports, or MI routers since they comes with access via application.."
16977,4,"Sharing this review after a one week use. Earlier I was using Dlink 600.   * Easy to configure * Dual band router within 1500Rs * 2.4 G will provide you enough single strength almost all corner of the house & 5 G will provide you good speed * Recommended for small house / office   I was not able to track my order delivery, which was the only issue.  However product got delivered."
16978,1,Am using this product since 1 month and am facing lot of problems. This device is not supported 100 mbps speed and the speed varies from 3mbps to 80mbps. Internet is not at all stable. Am very disappointed with this product.😕👎
16979,5,"This dual band router works like charm . The 5ghz has very good speed and also no problem while using 2.4ghz . After using asus RT-n12+ for 5+ years i think i have choosed the right product, it fits the right budget 👍🏻go for it 😊"
16980,4,This is a very good router for a connection of 80mbps. It gives very good coverage in 2.4 ghz wifi and 5Ghz coverage is not so bad. It actually covers 3 rooms easily with 5 ghz and sometimes it may cover the full one floor of the house if the router is placed cleverly in the appropriate direction. The 2.4 ghz range is awesome and speed of 2.4 ghz is good too. I mean it will easily give you 70 Mbps in 2.4 ghz but the 5 ghz is overall very fast in terms of very high speed upto 100 Mbps. The rou...
16981,5,The product is a very good choice for middle class homes....that is it is available at a affordable range. The quality of the product is very good....it gives a high speed and meets all my demands. Nice choice!
16982,1,Not up to the mark Only supports 4 devices before latency drops over WiFi (counting all the devices connected to it on both bands wirelessly) Been using it by lan for gaming due to latency drops Glitchy UI and have to reload the same page multiple times to confirm a command The schedule feature does not work on Mac address filter (hopefully will be sorted in updates) You cannot assign specific speed to specific Mac addresses the main purpose I bought it for. 5ghz is a scam this bandwidth is...
16983,4,Good dilevery time and as well as my experience it is good product and speed is too good..
16984,4,I have just been using it for 2 weeks now so far no problem with the product. Overall it's has a good design and I pretty much like it So yea I will recommend this product to anyone who is interested in buying this product.
16985,5,Good product in budget rate ...thanks hdfc bank for voucher ... Range is superb as my friend on lower floor enjoy wi-fi without any disturbance... value for money at this price.
16986,5,"Very good product. The 5ghz connection covers very less area (for say just a area of 5m²). But the 2.5ghz area covers a lot of area. It goes to the upper floor also. I'm using this product from the past few days, and I'm really happy with it. I use. Alliance broadband connection (network provider) with the product."
16987,5,Awesome product. Dual band running simaltenenously. Range of 5.0 GHz band is small but super fast and 2.4 GHz is as usual wide with good connectivity.
16988,5,Best Router I Really Like It With His Performance ❣️ And Thank You Flipkart For Fast Delivery In Lockdown. I Order Yesterday & Get Today 👍
16989,5,This definitely does cover a lot of area than the single antenna options by dlink I've used before. Works awesome and a lot of cool features. Love the guest mode especially
16990,5,Very good product under this price range... The coverage of the 2.4 and 5ghz bands are excellent and it provides good bandwidth... The build quality is awesome and overall its an excellent product..
16991,5,Good product best router best range and fast network
16992,4,Best for 1bhk. 2.4 ghz range is average. But device is good it's support dual band 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz. 5ghz range is only for single room
16993,4,Everything was good accept the packaging idk y this time they packd the good their self it was plainly packd like when u buy from a store. I have purchased menu time but this time I'm kinda disappointed. Other from that everything was good.
16994,5,Genuine Review 1. Flipkart delivered the product before the estimate time. 2. In this price range this is the best router. 3. 2.4GHz has better frequency than 5GHz. But 5GHz speed is awesome. 4. Stable network from both band. In short its a truly satisfying router.
16995,4,"For basic use it is the best choice 👌👌😉 Also if u want a great range ,for 2.4 GHz it gives fabulous range but for 5 GHz it give only 10 feet overall range in a spare... Still the quality and performance wise one of the finest ... If u want a good router in a value for money prize range ... It's one of the best choice... 💓💓💓"
16996,4,Its a well built classy looking and obviously preety good working machine. Though its a older generation model and I am suggesting not to buy this product though it's price to performance is pretty good...
16997,3,"Range is good (1st floor and 2nd floor) when router is kept outside the house, inside the house range is not good for 1st floor, deminsion of the house is 50x30 feet, net drops for mobile devices for fixed devices it works Ok"
16998,5,Nice Router Bht 5GHz Range Is Too Low Even In Second Room It Shows Only 2 Bars Of Wifi
16999,5,"Got it on the second day after placing the order. Thanks to Flipkart team for faster delivery. Now coming to the product review, I bought it for extending range of my JioFi. I don't have broadband connection, so I use the router as a repeater. So, it does works as a repeater. First, I tested in an open area. The speed test showed almost the same result conpared to my normal speed when tested as a repeater. Now about the range. I connected the router and placed it in a room. My PC is after 2 r..."
17000,5,Very Good Works like a charm and great Band Separation
17001,5,Happy with the product and it’s performance. Extremely easy to setup and handy for a home setup. Good customer service.
17002,5,Best Dual band router in this price I buy at 999/- awesome range of both band the important thing is placement of router I placed in centre of my house(2500sqft) height of 9 ft it cover all my House . it surprise me when I got 2wifi signals in last room at 5ghz plan of internet is 60mbps of alliance broadband at 5ghz I got 65mbps and 50mbps at 2.4ghz
17003,3,"Cost effective but with very limited Speeds and range.  This dual band router is available for offers from Rs 1200 onwards which enticed me into buying the same. The router was pretty easy to setup and installation did not prove to be a hassle.  But the range of the 5GHz and 2.4 GHz antennas leave a lot to be desired. In a two story house, you can pretty much ignore the 5GHz as the range is very limited, maybe to the room in which the router is kept. Even though the 2.4GHz range is available ..."
17004,5,"Perfect and good design also Excellent in WiFi range but 5ghz is not as powerful like 2.5ghz, because 5ghz is not provide high range, but I like dlink 819 router. thank you Flipkart."
17005,5,"Perfect dual bandrouter for my house. 5ghz has less range so it is used for my Android TV. No buffering of videos. 2.4ghz is used for other devices and has excellent coverage. Dlink Official App does not support this, only drawback. I am using this for last 2 weeks and no issues found till now...i will add further observation after couple of months. Till now device rocks."
17006,5,Best router powered by D-Link. DIR-819 was dual band router one based on 2.4 GHz and another is 5 GHz . With have maximum capable speed of 750 Mbps. Build quality is best plastic body with glass finished. It work as both router and repeater. 2.4 GHz band range around 45-50 meter and 5GHz band around 35-40 meter that's very good.
17007,5,Super router. You will see 2 SSID(If your mobile or laptop support 802.11a) in your mobile or laptop. One SSID is 2.5 GHz and another is 5 GHz. Connect 5 GHz to get full speed. Connect 2.5 GHz if your device is not supported to 5 GHz.  I am giving review after 4 months. I have not faced a single issue with it.  Thank you.
17008,5,very nice product and has good range for wifi and including a higher range for wifi compatible tv's can cover up to 2 floors even of obstacle it's working great with tv
17009,5,WiFi router range was very good . I love this product very much I think I hv get this product very good price also. I get very good price in deal . I get this projlduct in just 1000 rs only/- thank you Flipkart . thanks seller also.
17010,5,"Yes. It's one of the best WiFi routers you can have. Obviously,it's DLink at the end of the day. Whatever broadband it is, it's easy to configure yourself and easy to access. no flicker in connections both GHZ work well . And provides the suitable and max speed taken up for you package."
17011,5,works perfectly with my BSNL Fiber.I am getting 50mbps speed.Really happy with the performance.5ghz range is not up to the mark.However looking at the price what more you will expect.Overall good router.My suggestion just go for it.
17012,5,Superb range and outstanding speed. It looks beautiful also. I am completely satisfied with it. Just go and buy it.
17013,5,Awsome purchase. Range is not so good but still it's work for me. It will not cover a whole 3 storey house but it can easily cover a 1200sqft flat.
17014,4,This router is good.It has good range on 2.4gz band but the 5 gz band range is not so great.The setup is very easy but sometimes the web page of d-link is crashing.After all it is a very good router in low price range.If someone have a high bugget then it is not for them.
17015,5,"Nice product under 1000, works nice with JioFiber router as a range extender as well as a router. Range is good. Setup is easy. Product is 10/10."
17016,5,Amazing speed with very good range. Fully Worth it. I just suggest everyone to purchase this router for good range and high speed.
17017,5,great one I bought this router because of dual channel bands and worth it buying although 5ghz range is not that good as we know why but if it connected then it gives you privilege than other band
17018,5,Absolute Wonder ! works like a charm 😻
17019,4,Ease of use .....very easy to setup..but the wifi bandwidth is very short...only suitable for shot places like ...100 sqyard
17020,4,I am very happy this modern very easy and fast
17021,5,Owesome product Fast and reliable. Range of the WiFi is prety good it's door penitentiary so good and affordable
17022,4,"router performance is good so far.. build quality is ok as per price brought it under Rs1200 ,duel band gives perfect range for small house ,very easy to setup"
17023,5,Product is good and wife range is good it support 5G and too fast nice easy to install and tqu to flipkart for nice product
17024,5,Nice product. Coverage is good and wifi speed remains stable. It does not heat up a lot. Best value for money.
17025,5,router is of decent built quality...Its a dual band router..both in 2.4 and 5ghz band u will get awesome speed..5ghz signal coverage is short..very less..This router is suitable for small home....
17026,5,Awesome router within budget. I am using this router from last 6 months then writing my review. All time I connected to multiple devices like 4 mobiles and 2 laptops but no problem with wifi speed. Router range is very powerful. So I am really happy and satisfied with the product.

17036,5,Very nice product ...
17037,4,Product is good but delivery was too late.
17038,4,Overall Good. But the setup configuration is bit confusing and there is no mobile application for this router to operate. That's the main drawback.
17039,4,Not so bad
17040,5,"Increased my JioFi M2 signal strength and coverage to a considerable level. about 70% better if not more. Tested with signal strength meter, it's woks great! The wired/wireless router can act as a router, repeater/extender/booster, creates strong wireless network with greater coverage area."
17041,5,very nice...
17042,5,fast delivery by flipkart.easy instalation.good speed.working good.
17043,4,range of the router is quite good . Wi-Fi user interface he is acceptable at this price but the range of Wi-Fi is very good. you can install different OS in this Wi-Fi
17044,5,Working fine and damn good speed. Very satisfied!!
17045,5,just awesome product in this price range.. anyone can go for it undoubtedly.. 👍👍
17046,1,Had configuration issue while using every time i switch on the power button.will not recommend this product
17047,1,Something wrong with router.Wifi gets disconnected automatically. Tried resetting but that also doesn't work. First time facing issue with Dlink. Even Not able to find this product on Official Dlink site for firmware upgrade.Similar product is there but not this Model.  Is this a real Dlink product?
17048,5,Good Product easy to install and setup...Range is also good.
17049,1,"This router is soo bad, everytime the electricity goes out I have to reset the router . And now I can't even return it !"
17050,3,nice range .nice products. I am happy..
17051,1,"not working properly,my service provider had said that product is not of good quality"
17052,5,This is the product.
17053,5,LOVELY PRODUCT ********** (10 STARS)
17054,3,"Delivered on time , Installed and everything working fine as of now. I am getting almost 90Mbps speed for my ACT 100Mbps plan in 5Hz connection. Wifi coverage is normal. Not any issue with the connection yet. Sometimes 2.5GHz is more faster than 5GHz"
17055,4,"after using 1 week signal strength is good, speed also good but 5Gz band signal not good, disconnecting every time"
17056,1,"I dont know if its only for my case. But after a month of use this router is not working properly. Internet is not accessible, alway shows no internet on both my laptop and mobile thought my ethernet connection is absolutely working fine. After turning on 5min and it stops giving internet access.. really bad experience with this product."
17057,4,This router delivered dual band Performance – Up to 300Mbps (2.4GHz) + 433Mbps (5GHz) to deliver fast wireless speeds. Look very attractive & damn easy setup. I am getting signals throughout my house.
17058,5,Best Router at this price...(rs-1099).. Range is good and the speed also very good. You should definitely go for it. Best value for money product.
17059,1,After Seeing the Positive Review I purchased the Router But It Turnout a Nightmare. I Call My Technician To Installation Of Router But Due It's Hardware Issue it can't able to save changes of my ISP To the Dlink Router. He tried Very Hard But Due to Manufacturing Defective Piece He was Unable To Save Changes In The Router. My 1500 Rs Goes In Vain As The Flipkart Refuses To Replacement Of My Product. Never Purchase A DLink Router Of Any Model From Flipkart. They Cheat The Customer. GO For TP ...
17060,5,Too much bad reviews regarding this router. It's true it has not that much range of like Mi 3c but more than enough for me.
17061,4,its quite vfm but lacks a app to control the settings which is offered by its competitors moreover 5ghz range is around 10 -14 m only but 2.4ghz range is crazy good upto 35 m pubg players will have to use the 5ghz always to avoid hing ping on the 2.4 one
17062,5,Good product..
17063,5,working as expected. great transmission speed and covers large area.
17064,4,"rooter is good range, but gatting hot"
17065,5,Love it😍😍
17066,4,"Both 2.5 and 5ghz are good, and nice simple network router."
17067,5,awesome product
17068,5,nice produt
17069,5,"one more best product from dlink, very low price range in duel band (2.4 & 5 G) support"
17070,5,Nice product 👌... I loving it...
17071,5,The product is very good as per the cost price. Good quality product.
17072,5,nice
17073,3,"WiFi Range is very less ,if you move to other room then WiFi signal drops significantly other wise quality of the product is good. We can use both 2.5G and 5Gbands simultaneously."
17074,1,its a fake dlink .. 5ghz range is tooo short and doesnt gives a proper speed . the model number dir819 is not mentioned in the official site also .. no dlink print on the router .. ..just a waste of time with money
17075,5,Initially it had some firmware issue with fiber-net connection so i had to contact d-link and upgrade the firmware to latest whoever wants to buy this just make sure after the purchase you upgrade the firmware from d-link support staff only!!!!!! after the upgrade its really good i mean dual band at this price point is great ...just go for it and don't forget to upgrade the firmware!!!
17076,1,"Coverage is extremely low, one should not buy this router."
17077,1,"signal coverage is bad, wastage of money."
17078,5,This is very useful product but range is too short.. otherwise is awsm..
17079,1,Very Very Bad Quality guys do not Buy this Product worth of money
17080,1,Worst.. everytime electricity goes off i have reset it.. and follow all the configuration procedure again.. this happens everytime electricity goes off or even switch off the power button.. what rubbish..
17081,1,The devices resets often and the connection will be lost in middle of work.... and the frequency is very less which doesn’t accommodate a normal connectivity even in 30x40 size home with rooms
17082,5,good product
17083,4,good product at this price range. make sure your mobile phone Or Laptop supports 5ghz wifi else you can use only one band
17084,5,"Atfirst I have received a faulty router. Problems are 1. No internet connection 2. Speed drop. 3. Cannot connect. Authentication error.  Faced may problems.  After that I visited service center, they have changed the board. And the scratched facial also replaced. Service is jst awesome.  Now. The router is superb. Like, 1. No speed drop. 2. Fast connect. 3. Tremendous range. Just superb experience from this router. My router is in the first floor and from the groud floor every phone has full ..."
17085,1,Am using this product since 1 month and am facing lot of problems. This device is not supported 100 mbps speed and the speed varies from 3mbps to 80mbps. Internet is not at all stable. Am very disappointed with this product.😕👎
17086,5,"Just osam, and range also good"
17087,5,Great Product. A must buy for each and every purpose. Highly satisfied with it
17088,1,stopped working after 1 month
17089,5,Good product. Almost covers all portions of the house
17090,5,Router is fantastic so satisfactions
17091,5,Ok
17092,1,Router keeps restarting . don't buy
17093,5,When i ordered this product i thought i did a mistake then i ordered mi router 4c and believe me mi router 4c is worst i returned it and now I'm happy with my D-Link router which is giving me 90-95 Mbps speeds in my 100mbps plan where as mi router was struggling to reach 50-60 Mbps Thanks flipkart lots of love
17094,1,Dual band comes with single or same pwd for both 5 and 2.4 GHz . it will jump automatically.  for mine it is not even worked for 2 days. It showing Yellow exclamatory symbol. Always show no internet secured.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL FROM DLINK.  if you want Dual band please buy from another brand.
17095,5,D-link router it's good brand....I'm satisfied
17096,5,Perfect router for my needs. No issues.
17097,5,"Writing after 1month use  Awesome router. But it's really difficult to setup. So much options are there and the manual has very less information. If you did not setup your router before, please call technician. Power adapter cable is really short (around 2 feet only).  Great strong signal (both 2.5 GHz and 5GHz). Worth of every penny. Just go for it."
17098,5,It's very Good Products 👍
17099,3,3 star is because the router is good but not up to the expectations.. I have got a 100mbps connection.. and with a 750 Mbps output router should perform at its best.. but I still find the network reach is little poor..
17100,1,"Experience is to quality not good. Product break link in continues and need to restart every day 5 to six time and aslo router suddenly automatically shutdown. Facing Wifi signal hang and break. Range also to short whenever router dual band and triple antina 750 mbps.. So, finally suggest don't but this model.."
17101,5,nice product.
17102,2,not worth
17103,5,"Range is good, Speed is awesome. Totally worthy!"
17104,4,Good product
17105,4,Good 😊
17106,5,nice range and connectivity upto 60 meters
17107,1,I was expecting a better range. I actually have to install the router in home in the very first room. The range is the problem here as there is no coverage after 3rd room. Bought this router because of range(already have Mi 3C router. MI router's range is better than this router). Waste of money. Also in gaming this router has some bugs. Sometimes not able to use voice chat while gaming. When I switched to other router the problem is not there.
17108,5,Wonderful speed and Range... But configuration is not so easy for everyone...
17109,5,it's better than mi router and its range over 40 meter at this price range it's the best router
17110,5,Good
17111,5,Wide Renge...Fast Forward..and
17112,1,Not speed router
17113,5,good super
17114,1,Please do not buy this router. The speed claims here are false. This router is not capable of going above 100Mbps at all. I have a 150Mbps connection and have tried all possible configs to achieve the speed with no success.
17115,5,the delivery boy was very nice and smart
17116,1,"Not working Properly 5ghz band range is so poor,heating issue"
17117,5,Best for 3 bhk
17118,1,Pathetic WiFi router Always hangs and I have to reset Please don’t take this one
17119,4,This modem is actually pretty good.
17120,1,It disconnect with network a lot of time. I configured it about 3 to 4 time a day
17121,1,"Not recommended, not a good product. Bought this router month ago. These are the issues with router I faced. 1. After a power outage, the router disconnects with Internet. we have to manually reboot both modem and router to get it restarted. 2. 5ghz network band range is very low. can't find 5ghz wifi at next room. 3. Corrupts video streaming from laptop to tv. Not sure if this is something which can be configured. 4. Web app interface often gives you error."
17122,5,good range
17123,1,Faulted device.... Don't buy it
17124,5,Super
17125,1,Don't buy this ... Poor strength... Worst product ever purchased
17126,2,Auto channel not support
17127,1,This router stopped working after 1 month. Tried calling DLink CC but couldn't reach out.
17128,5,Nice
17129,5,Good
17130,5,Best router for Office & home But Don't expect long range for 5Ghz band because any router has limited range with full speed for this 5Ghz band. Now coming to 2.4Ghz band ot has long range but less speed. This is the basic working of wiFi bands in any router. If wanted full speed WiFi network at your office and home go for it.  Note :- keep the router in the Hall or living room to get complete speed at your home. If you are using in office keep it in center of office to gain full speed...  ...
17131,4,Problem in 5gz range. But over all value for money at this price range
17132,5,great network and has boosted the speed of internet by around 4 to 5 times when compared to my last single antenna router. working great
17133,5,Very good router must buy. I have 60Mbps alliance internet and router gives 60mbps both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz. Maintain broadband speed correctly. All know what should be the range of 5ghz signal and it don't disappoint me. Any one whose budget 1600 they should try this. Until till now (6days uses) no problem has been faced.
17134,5,PLEASE DO GO FOR IT. Was using a Tp Link single band router before & now with this one even my gaming issues are resolved via 5ghz & the signal range is Awesome on another level . With Tp link i was thinking i might have to use range extender on my ground floor but this one covers every corner of my house from top to ground floor even my friend's house beside me. I am using a Railwire broadband connection & never in 24 hrs my wifi or signal drops. #HIGHLY_RECOMMENDED.
17135,1,It's a dual band but my 5ghz is not working
17136,3,Product was fine. But ip address doesn't match when connecting to network.
17137,3,Ok But not Good.
17138,5,"Wifi router is so effective, this range is fabulous. Very good product,"
17139,1,It's not working worst item I use only 10 day after that it's not working
17140,3,Packing is not at all good.. It is visible to everyone
17141,4,Average
17142,2,"Very bad,signal loss problem"
17143,1,Not working properly
17144,1,Very bad item.not working with Hathway MNP network and cancel net.net connect also cut down in the middle time
17145,3,This router is not that good as mentioned. It only offers 100mbps speed even though my connection is greater than that. Go for AC1200 if you manage the budget.
17146,5,The product really good
17147,4,Router is good but charger is Local class.. Damaged itself in 20days only
17148,1,There is a connectivity issue when power goes on/off need to reset the router done the all configuration then it will be worked
17149,2,Range of wifi is too much limited
17150,5,Excellent product. Range about 120 meters. Speed is Very good 🤠 😊😊 value for money ☺️
17151,2,Poor speed not up to the mark
17152,3,Well for low budget
17153,1,Its worst product... Don't waste money...When power failure again configure required each time.
17154,1,worst router available in the market today... latest firmware available to download.. able to save settings after trying for multiple times.. latency from router to desktop gets high even when I connected via LAN.. The router cannot be used in amplifier mode due to issues in the settings
17155,3,"Admin panel UI is not user friendly. Changing any settings from admin panel is quite problematic, failed multiple times before saving. Not support WPA2 & WPA3 security, which is unacceptable nowadays. No updated firmware available. Speed and range is good for me."
17156,1,Bad configuration setup.
17157,4,Nice
17158,5,Nice product
17159,1,Stoped working after a month
17160,1,"completely waste product, does not work, please do not buy this product. it's completely waste. they don't even take calls or reply to email. if they do not respond then they should close their rubbish company."
17161,1,i am using this router for last 6 month.Wrost router had seen. SSID does not shown after power off on. its strange to use
17162,1,It's not a user friendly
17163,5,Probably the best router in this price range which has dual band connectivity.
17164,1,does not work properly
17165,1,Very bad quality.. Does not work properly.
17166,4,If r u taking basic packs then u don't need this router. A normal 2.4ghz is enough for that
17167,1,Never purchase anyone it work properly for just 1 week And now it's showing many problems
17168,1,Due to made in China.... It's not Taiwan product
17169,5,"Best router under 1500/-.  Tested Internet Speed over Wi-Fi: 120 Mbps  No heating issue at all... It can be left Powered On for month without any issue.  Best for 700-800 sqft area, single floor. Low coverage can be noticed on another floor."
17170,5,Superb performance for that price segment
17171,5,Range of 2.4 GHz bandwidth signal is excellent. Good choice for spreading a 100 Mbps connection across the home.
17172,4,Unfortunately we dont have any good indian company to manufactur router else I had chosen any other indian company over chinese. This product is gOod but. It's chinese
17173,1,This item has many problems for pppoe connection so i suggest you not purchase this item and flipkart show less price of this product then not be purchased this product
17174,1,"Worst product it has issues with the connection, it keeps disconnecting from network"
17175,1,Dont buy this... Connectivity problem is there... Go for tenda routers
17176,1,Network connectivity is too bad
17177,4,Nice. Very Lite Weight.
17178,4,"This product is good Few points which i want to discuss 1. Wifi range of 5 ghz is 10-15 mtrs and 2.4 ghz is 20-25 mtrs 2. Bootup time is around 2-3 mins 3. Speed is upto the mark  [Note- my friends suggested me to buy TP-link c-20 but when i checked the specifications of both then i found that they are identical even price was same at that time, no difference so it's upto you which one you want to buy]"
17179,5,At the price of 1299 it is beast...
17180,5,Great one.
17181,5,"Nice product ,working good, I am happy, thanks of flipcart for available this product. Naiknaware Bhaskar,Aurangabad Maharashtra."

17184,3,Low network coverage and weak signal.
17185,1,Not much good
17186,2,Below average router.....

17188,1,Singal strength is very weak dont buy this product
17189,1,I have Hathaway pppoe connection. Using this router my connection getting disconnect and not reconnecting back. Hathaway engineer told its a problem with Dlink's router any other router will work fine.
17190,5,Very effective and nice product
17191,1,"Once the router is turned off and back ON, the internet doesn't work and have to reset the router and again go through the configuration process from the scratch. Every day morning it's the same story. Got the replacement but same issue. Repenting the purchase"

17196,1,"It has been horrible experience with this device, my old single band router is working better than this. Is there a way to return this after return period is expired? Its of no use to me!"
17197,1,"It is fluctuating a lot the network is not stable in this, it cuts in between Go for tp link router if u people are looking for router."
17198,1,"Plz dont buy it, worst quality product.. Go for tp Link"

17211,1,"Waste router. Did a mistake not reading specifications before buying. This router has a 10/100 Mbps WLAN port. It can never support more than 100Mbps speed. Their claim of having a combined speed of 750 Mpbs is false. I updated my Internet connection of 150Mbps but this router won't go more than 100Mbps. Waste of money, return period is over now else would have returned."

17228,1,Worst product the connection get terminated frequently. Even the service providers suggest this is the worst product.
17229,1,1. Waste of money. Too many problems. 2. Internet gets disconnected again and again. 3. Settings are sometimes saved and sometimes not. 4. Of no use as i have to Reboot and Reset it many times to make it work. 3-4 internet disconnection daily. Go for TP link they r quite stable i hv heard. 5. No pc software to manage it.

17540,4,Good one
17541,1,SCAM ALERT!! SCAM!! This review is for those who will think this will transmit 300mbps through wifi. NO IT WON'T. If you have an internet connection with more than 100mbps and you want a router to increase range please don't but this. You'll get only 100mbps after the router even in ethernet and wifi. Its a scam. Please buy GIGABIT port router. This 750Mbps ad is a scam.
17542,1,"Very poor ,"

17577,5,great one...
17578,5,"Been using it for 4days now. The installation process was easy, just had to connect ISP for the IP/DNS address and you would be good to go with the installation process.  The range is pretty better than the DIR-219, which I have been using for the past 4years. Previously, the wifi would be around the house periphery but this router spreads the signal to upto around 15m radius around my house, though with lower strength as you go far from it.  Overall satisfied with the product. I expect this ..."

17596,4,Good router for normal usage upto 100 Mbps on 5Ghz with a decent coverage. Note: If u own a latest laptop with latest wifi 6 driver do not buy this router it will have unstable connection on 5Ghz band and will show unable to connect error. 2.4 Ghz band works fine. No problem on other devices.

And even if I can see strong signal strength it won't give me speed browsing YouTube will work but all of a sudden it buffers soo much, but like I sai..."

17776,5,It's most valuable product . Value for money.
17777,5,After One year of purchase the router is working fine. It gives expected speed of 120 MBps as per my internet connection and can handle multiple devices. I have used upto 20 devices and the speed didn't fell much.
17778,5,"One of my friends suggested this router instead of Gigabyte which is bit expensive then this. But it gives me full satisfaction after installing this device. I am getting almost thrice the speed what I was getting before. Easy to install, range is also working fine at my premises for both 5gh and 2.5gh."
17779,2,"It's not working as mentioned ...it always losse the connection and tells u wifi has no acces to internet. This type issues are also with other wifi but your connection will come back in 2 or 3 min but in this case , it wil take months or may be a year untill you replug the wires and connect it again... Totally waste"
17780,5,Nice but I am use also late
17781,3,If you gonna use 5ghz from different floor of your house.....then u might face speed drop. So use 5ghz wifi option only when u r on same floor at which router is installed.
17782,5,Good
17783,5,Nice
17784,4,Satisfactory but the range is low not more than 3-4 meters .
17785,1,Better go for TP-Link.

17822,3,The product quality is average according to it's price. Build quality could be better. Getting trouble connecting 5GHz band. Minimal and glossy design is attractive.
17823,5,Good Product
17824,5,As my Internet pack is of 30 Mbps. This Router has given me a speed of 29-30Mbps (For 2.4Ghz) and 78Mbps Downloading speed (in 5Ghz).
17825,5,Ok
17826,3,The first one that I recieved was a defected one and it took me nearly a week to get it replaced after n number of calls. But the product is good and recommendable. Don't buy if you have an urgency because by chance you find a defect these people will literally test your patience to the core.
17827,5,"Super Speed At My Home With Dual Band ,30 Mbps Is Enough With This Combo ,I can suggest must Buy without any Doubt. Super Range ......."
17828,4,"Got damaged Product, does not detected by laptop or mobilep"
17829,3,It is only supporting 100 mbps. If you are looking for higher speed wifi routers you may have to go for higher configuration
17830,5,Very good
17831,4,Good coverage area for 1BHK & 2nd will also get good network but speed will be low
17832,5,Good
17833,4,"Lost it's network several times... wifi network strength is ok, not so good . Other wise it's ok"
17834,4,I got best deal with this one works best as per performance
17835,5,"This is an Excellent Product. I have been using it since 08 Feb 2020. It's been 1.5Yrs, using it continuously in the lockdown with no issues till date. Love this product. I have also recommended this product to my friend & he is also happy with it."

17848,3,"It's coverage range is less, if you want to use it with in a room no issue. In my case I had bad experience like the signal used to drop frequently, I don't know it is a general problem or specific case. I am using tp-link A6 now It's fantastic."
17849,5,A very good and best router I have ever seen
17850,1,Worst router ever. Worked good for a year and afterwards the signal became extremely weak. Get a TP Link router. It's way better.

17916,5,Superb speed and range.
17917,4,"I am writing this after using it for 7 days, range is pretty good, 5ghz band is pretty stable(many router have stability issue in the 5ghz band). 2.4 ghz best for long range coverage, ventilation is pretty good. Let's see if it holds up in the long run, i heard dlink is not good in it's firmware support, gonna test that out and update it here."

18044,4,Satisfied
18045,3,This not exact router which I was looking for. Still low network speed due to it's maximum speed 100mbps.
18046,4,Good Product.

18071,5,Super quality n good product
18072,5,Very good quality and it is working fine. anyone go for it who needs upto 700 mbps speed and dual band in this price value for money.
18073,5,"this is the cheapest dual-band WiFi that I could found. the set-up process is very simple and this is a very fast router. If you have devices that support a 5GHz band this is a very good investment. There is venting on the router to manage heat and when used extensively this could heat up. the build quality is good, but the power adaptor is cheap looking. Please note that is not a modem but a WiFi router."
18074,5,Good range go for it one best in this price
18075,5,Good dual band router delivered within 1day😍

18299,5,"Excellent product, thankq flipkart"
18300,4,Awesome router at very economical price. As it has dual band. I am using one for my work and the other one for devices in my house. Only draw back is the D-Link app won't support this product. So you need to be hard wired to control the devices connected to the device
18301,5,Good
18302,5,Nice to make it as a repeater (if you used this as a Repeater you router password must not use any special characters )

18408,3,Dlink admin UI is not all good very confusing... Don't understamd need to configure twice one 2.5G and another for 5G... Else range is good... It feels that router sometimes stops the connection and then again resumes after 2 3 mins... Due to which it feels very annoying when you watch TV or connected to VPN...

18414,5,"This product offers the advantage of dual band, which looks quite good at this price range. However, 5Ghz band has very limited area coverage because of its high freq. Obstructions damp the signal very fast. 2.4Ghz signal offers good coverage at all corners of the house."

18507,5,Nice
18508,5,"Excellent product. Setup was easy. Been using it from past 2 months and have not faced a single issue be it range or consistence. D-Link (Taiwanese company) is much better than tp-link, tenda and other chinese routers which fail within few months of purchase (had a bad experience with my earlier tp-link purchased offline). Router pairs perfectly with Cuzor CZ-01A-12 for power backup in case of power outage."
18509,5,Nice product
18510,5,Good
18511,5,"amazing product, the quality of the product is perfect , service provided by flipkart is excellent. It also has warranty of 3 years and you can also get servicing of your product if the product is in warranty period. thank you flipkart"
18512,4,"After using 1 month 27 days- now it is very bad, the router is creating more issue to connect the modem, after restaring it 4-5 times, then it connect with modem. When you switch off the power and switch on the power again, then it will not conet with modem.  If any one can help me ,please let me know. I suggest don't buy this device.  I talked to customer care and he helped me to configure the router now I m feeling this is good.  Please buy this and ask for configuration from customer."

18526,5,This is the best i have used till yet. I have 75mbps plan and on 2.4ghz i get 70mbps download and upload and on 5ghz i get 76 to 80mbps download... Value for miney.. Must buy this
18527,4,"The router works well. The 5G channel works only in Line of Sight devices. 2.4G has a wider range but mostly range is limited. Although full signal may show as available in wider range, it only works best in a 800 sq.ft surrounding. Hence the 4 star rating."

18544,3,not working with GTPL connection
18545,4,"Everything is good. I am using from past 15 days. Coverage area is good for 2.4Ghz but not for 5Ghz. There is no app to it to change settings or to know how much data we consumed or to know how many devices are connected. They will provide you a website where you can change settings but website is not at all good. You need to refresh everytime you change the setting. When compared to this, MI router is best to manage the router easily but dlink provides you 3 years warranty and we know dlink ..."

18583,1,Device is too much slow and not connecting more then 3 connection. I am feeling very sad after buying this
18584,1,"Very bad experience from D-Link...It is a faulty router....on a 3rd moth of purchase it is not working.  1. Power light start blinking anytime and the router goes offline, it goes out of range for all the wireless and wired devices. 2. Wi-Fi range is very poor...geeting poor range in 5+ meter distance with 5Ghz connection. 3. No Firmware update, the current firmware is also faulty, not showing the status and sessions information.  Basically its a very poor product both Hardware and Software."
18585,4,Speed is good . Frequency is good .but some it doesn't show network.

18598,5,"Very good router if yoir internet connection is upto 100Mbps, just make sure the router configuration/setup is done properly.  Note: This will not support internet speeds higher than 100Mbps. For 200Mbps - 1Gbps connections better to go for a Gigabit router."
18599,4,Nice one
18600,3,"It's too light weight, doesn't give feel of durable, Everything is ok but range is very low, 5Ghz range is 4,5 m only, and 2.4Ghz range is not so good as others routers"

18638,5,Its a good router with decent price. I think this is the only dualband router available under 1.2k. Wifi range also decent.
18639,4,Nice but range decreased by day to day
18640,5,Best price
18641,5,My experience with this is gud no issue found using from 3 months.. got it for around 1k..

18660,5,Good product...
18661,4,"Range is good only, after two walls block speed get reduced drastically. Turn off the Bluetooth while using wifi, since both use 2.4 GHz it reduces the speed. Good for 2BHK, ensure to place router where wall blocks are minimum."
18662,5,"Been 15 days,Pretty good router!No issues!I get signal all acrossmy home!"

18674,5,Nice
18675,3,I don't know why but this is not as good as I expected The 2.4 ghz wifi range is pretty low as compare to tp link and other routers..
18676,5,"awesome,works as expected.."
18677,2,Range is very poor. Hardly get any network for above/below floor.
18678,4,"Good product, specific speed achieved with dual band."

Its really bad for customers"
18680,5,This product is very good it is very use Full I like it and I am so happy❤️❤️❤️ all buyers purchase this item ❤️
18681,1,Very very poor quality
18682,4,Nice quality and very first network Overall good👍👍
18683,1,The worst wifi router i had ever seen... the range is very low ... its range is similar to tenda 301 whose price is just 600 or 700... sometimes the router restarts itself... so if u r looking for a router which is good in range then dont buy this one..
18684,5,Osm
18685,5,Product is very good.
18686,4,Good
18687,5,Good

18689,4,Awesome 👍
18690,5,Very good
18691,5,Osham product
18692,3,Only a router does not have inbuilt modem or DSL port
18693,4,I am happy.. buy this product
18694,1,Writing this review after using this router for a year now. This router gets disconnected every now and then. Very bad signal range and speed.
18695,4,Resolved my problem ....working perfect with good coverage . .
18696,3,"Better go for TP link in dlink no app to monitor  not easy to configure,  sometimes wifi does not work and then you have just plug an LAN to laptop then it will work"
18697,5,Great product delivered on time.
18698,4,Nice in this price band
18699,5,Nice... Good sirf and coverage
18700,5,excellent
18701,2,Frequency is not up to the mark
18702,4,very good
18703,2,"Disconnecting frequently, I should have gone through the reviews thoroughly :( Believe me and go for other router!"
18704,5,As A Expected Speed Gives Fast 5G It's Cover My Whole Bunglow Wireless Network Internet Speed around 1950Sqft....
18705,3,Good
18706,5,Nice product
18707,5,Good product at this price range
18708,5,Very good product. Definitly go for it. And I got a very fast delivery #3 days earlier than the listed date. And this router cover a very good range.
18709,1,Worst product
18710,2,It does provide good speed in the same room but it does not have good coverage. Coverage of my single band dual antenna router is much better than this. I will not recommend it as it doesn't have enough coverage.
18711,5,Totally satisfied with this Router. Works perfectly as expected. No connection issue. Really useful dual band wifi. Go for it.
18712,5,"Issue some time of reconnecting.. but overall the product is great for signal strength and it had modes low,medium and high you can choose it. you can use this as a extender alo.. overall product is good.."
18713,4,"It's a really awesome one. We can buy for a small house, fixed at hall in my 1bhk 5GHz been covering my entire Home. 5Ghz range is little disappointment. Where speed is as expected per my allocated Bandwidth. Yes no hesitation in buying it, purely 4* for the performance and little disappointment with the 5G Hz range."
18714,1,No support of this legacy device. Dont buy it. if you just want to use as normal router for <10 Mbps connection then fine. Else it is complete waste of money. you cannot use it as a proper repeater(or range extender) if you want to couple if with another router to extend the range.
18715,3,It's range is not that much good...
18716,1,"It only works 1 band, 5Ghz band is not working, it disconnects automatically."
18717,1,We are having an issue with the software
18718,5,"5 GHz is connecting only to laptops and PCs, that too high data transfer can be seen in vicinity of router. Whereas 2.5 GHz one connect is in the whole house."
18719,3,Nice looking.
18720,4,Offers good coverage and connectivity options also is also pretty apt in this price
18721,3,Good
18722,1,5ghz not working 😕
18723,4,The device fulfilled my needs. But the piece I received was manufactured in 2016. So out of the box the firmware used is old. Felt bad. During holiday sales companies just cheat and you realise the problem only after use.
18724,3,Ok
18725,4,Nice
18726,5,Great option for home use
18727,1,Automatically disconnects. No internet issues. Worst Router. Go for the TP LINK or Netgear instead.
18728,5,It is working fine
18729,5,Good product
18730,5,Excellent product
18731,4,Good product
18732,1,Normal ..chif
18733,4,Working good nice condition but first time i have damage products but second time is good nice products
18734,4,"Best in this price range , But it did not support optical fibre cable.."
18735,5,Working good...
18736,5,I have been using this for more than 10 days now & haven't faced any issues.. the WiFi coverage is very good throughout the house.
18737,3,Product is average!
18738,1,Wrost Product very Bad speed
18739,5,No issues noticed when using the product. Does the job
18740,4,Nice Router
18741,5,I use 2 router but this is the best in range
18742,3,"Received after 17 days... The product is worth 5* but delivery was very late, especially in a metropolitan city like Mumbai"
18743,1,Fully faltoo item
18744,5,Working well
18745,5,Good
18746,5,"After using for 8 months, l can say that it is one of the best Routers."
18747,4,Good quality
18748,2,No range and cheap quality when i ask to return it flipkart is not accepting my request fail product!
18749,5,Good luck
18750,5,Excellent
18751,1,"Range matching with 2 antenna not 3. 3rd antenna doesn't seems to improve range, otherwise working good"
18752,2,"It is not 750 mbps, its max speed is only 100 mbps, why you have written 750mbps??"
18753,5,Superb and excellent Working I use this router for bridge connection from my fiber router
18754,3,Expectations not reached
18755,5,It's good not too bad. I will suggest to go with the new models.
18756,5,Nice
18757,1,Worst. Often getting reset
18758,5,Nice products in 1300
18759,4,Go for it
18760,4,Working fine. 5hz range is quite low. Rest is ok
18761,5,Best dual band router at this price range.
18762,3,"Range is very poor. The 5Ghz signal is not reachable beyond 2m.2.4Ghz too has poor range though much better than the 5Ghz one(7-8m).Regarding the speeds,I get 90Mbps for a 100 Mbps connection for 5ghz while 70mbps in 2.4 ghZ. Disappointed"
18763,5,Nice product
18764,3,Good
18765,5,Realy osum... Product best signle range.. 😍😍😍😘
18766,1,"Range very good but connectivity is very low, connection are be broken"
18767,4,Really good router but you need a little bit of knowledge about configuration before set it up. Otherwise it's a really good device. The only problem I felt is there is a slight gap of signal with router and beta converter. If you are ok with it then cheer's.
18768,1,Worest Quality
18769,3,Good price
18770,1,There is no either net cable in the box Very worst delivery
18771,5,It is good and covering 900 squremeter flat im each room easily and better speed..
18772,2,"This router not working properly ,I am facing sometimes wifi signal drop."
18773,5,I like the range of the router. Build quality is not premium but good at this price point .
18774,5,Very good router for home and home office. Please go for it if you 're nit heavy user.
18775,5,"Got at 1139 , best price ... No need to think. Get. It does worth your penny."
18776,5,Ok
18777,3,Not bad
18778,3,If you are planning to buy in this budget go for tp link because this router does not have its application to control
18779,4,The product is ok
18780,5,Good one..ordered 2nd time for nephew
18781,5,It is agood product in this price
18782,3,Good
18783,1,A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE THIS TIME I HAD WITH THIS PRODUCT. A TOTALLY WORST PRODUCT WILL BE THE SUITABLE NAME FOR THIS ROUTER. I CHANGED THIS ROUTER TWO TYPES AND BOTH THE TIMES THE ROUTER WAS CORRUPTED FROM ITS SOFTWARE.
18784,1,"Defective product received.. after repaired still facing connectivity issue, connection get disabled frequently."
18785,5,Good
18786,5,Good ❤️
18787,5,"Very Good range and pretty good interface. I get only 433 Mbps in 5 ghz, I do not completely understand how they mention the speed. However worth the price. Appreciate the prompt delivery too."
18788,4,Good product
18789,3,Just Ok. Don't get fooled by reviews.
18790,5,Good service..great deal..thank u flipkart
18791,4,"product is good, but the range of the product is not soo good. little over price product"

18826,5,Nice product
18827,5,Superb quality
18828,5,Aswme product Thanks
18829,1,Worst product keeps getting disconnected .after using 6 months
18830,1,It’s disconnecting very frequently...
18831,4,Good for midrange houses not suitable for villas or multi-floored households because of range (install in a good placement for better range)
18832,5,Can work like extender as well as router
18833,4,That's Nice 🙂 Value for money.
18834,5,Working perfectly
18835,5,Nice😌😌
18836,2,Wifi range is to low not even for 12meter
18837,1,Useless ...
18838,3,Wifi speed is good but you can't expect range
18839,4,Good product and price is reasonable.
18840,5,Very nice product by flipcart..but router has no optical fibre press cord.. I have buy a oinur box extra on market.. price of rupees 1000
18841,3,Dual band work good
18842,4,"It's good,..."
18843,1,Lan internet connection not connected
18844,5,Nyc
18845,3,"Wifi range is not satisfied, don't buy this product"
18846,5,nice products

18849,5,Nice
18850,5,Good product...
18851,3,The default login page has some issues
18852,5,Too good at this price Good Value for Money
18853,5,nice product
18854,1,nice product ok range nice build in quality. simple to install modern software interface can use as router or extender directly. but lots of time speed automatically slow down in LAN connection and WiFi network disappearance. need to restart router frequently. don't buy it. even my old TP-LINK TL-WR841N working very good as compare to this model. very disappoints from ttp-link.
18855,5,I'm happy with this product. It's really good product and I think I have purchased over a perfect product. Range of the signal is enough for me and it gives me superb signal whether I am in the room or I am in another floor.
18856,5,"Recommend it as this is a great router with a good range and can handle multiple devices with ease. It's been 4 months and I am completely satisfied with its performance. And as a cherry on top, it has a very user-friendly app to monitor its access and other settings."
18857,4,"For the price this is a decently good router with single band four antina router. I have a 60mbps lan connection and its works great , also the range is also very good. Using its about a month now its good ✌️"
18858,4,"it's range is much less compared to mi 3c positives 1. latest features according to latest developments in wireless technology. 2. it has 3 modes wireless LAN , wireless repeater and access point , since this is my second router in the house and I am not a fan of repeater i am using in access point mode. 3. Good design aesthetic wise. negatives 1.No 5ghz AC mode support however at this price only iBall provides it. 2. Range is a big issue 3 antennas seems to be for show purpose mi 3c gives ..."
18859,3,The range is good but the problem is speed decreased when i compare with my dlink single antenna router and ping is also too high like 80-120 so for mobile and pc gaming iwont prefer it . Add some money and buy good one
18860,5,Great nice products...it has good range with 3 antenna... compared to market price..I got 970/-....it's good deal.... thanks Flipkart..
18861,5,"very good wifi. I'm using this one as a range extender and is working fine for me.  you can easily connect it with your existing wifi router and place it within range of the existing wifi. You just need to follow the steps as per manual for installing as a range extender.  Very happy with the product, mostly with the range extender mode."
18862,5,"Initial impression is great. I don't know why people is complaining about range. This thing got exceptional wifi range, the signal is also super stable. Just place it somewhere high also keep away from walls and metals. App is just for the name, only basic stuffs in app. Wifi recieving and transmission power is very good. 5 stars for it. Let's see how well it goes. Will definitely update in future if anything goes wrong. Packing was below avarage, came in its own carton. No proper packing was..."
18863,4,Well the product is still working well... It's been almost a month since I have purchased it... So recommended for people wanting to buy a new router... Great purchase 😇💙💙
18864,5,Awesome product. Very easy setup. Very fast connect. Don't go for D-Link or mi wifi. Waste of money and big process to configure internet on those wifi boxes.
18865,4,in 900 its a good router to buy. gives good range and the durability is also good and build quality is good.
18866,5,First of all it got dillivered very soon even before the time and how it was shown in the image it was actually like that in real overall a nice product even in this Price...... absolutely happy with the performance and you should definitely buy it 👌🏻👍🏻
18867,5,"AMAZING PRODUCT RANGE IS QUITE GOOD AND THE PRICE IS ALSO LOW IF YOU GO TO MARKET FOR BUYING THIS IT WILL COST MORE THAN 3000 RUPPES ....... ABOUT THE SPECIFICATION :-  TOTALLY IT HAS 5 ETHERNET CABLE PORT  IN THE BOX IT HAS THE ROUTER,RJ45  IT HAS THREE ANTEENA.  IF YOU WANT ONLINE GAMING AT AT A LOW COST IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.  IT IS BETTER AT HD STREEMING  OVER ALL GOOD PRODUCT AT A LOW PRICE.  MUST BUY......."
18868,1,Not great product at all. My single antina router is doing better or almost the same. Expected better range .
18869,5,"very beautiful, very good user-friendly interface, and better build quality. Has no cons. It is a pro wifi router in this price range"
18870,3,Good basic router with easy to configure function and mobile app to manage it.  However don't get too impressed looking at 3 antennas in my option they are not serving the purpose.  The range is only slightly better compared to my 6 year old router.  I started using router after a week of delivery and hardly got time to check the range and strength and hence return period was over or I've would have returned the router.
18871,3,"It is a good product, very good capturing capacity , nice range overall very Good product."
18872,5,Best router in the price. Good Range and wireless internet speed is coming good than my previous router. The another best thing is the mobile app which have good user interface and functionality.  You can also set up a guest login without sharing the guests the actual passwords. There is also a IPTV mode. I will look into it.  There are also different setup options. ❤ Loved the product ❤
18873,5,The speed is good and the connection is strong & reliable as well as it's easy to configure. It's lightweight and looks great. The TP link app also has a lot of features.
18874,3,"three stars are because it performs well without any hardware issue. Renowed brandings. surely you can buy this, but if good range is your concern they you should find other option. i stay in slums horizontal distribution of range is good enough but vertically its weak. there are little variation in speed. my final verdict is at this budget superb deal"

19183,5,Very good working.👍🏻
19184,5,Too good
19185,5,Frst wanted to go for Tplink_Wr840n but after a detailed study chose this. REASON-has 3 antennas which provide a better transmission then 2 antennas. And in the future can also go for wired connection. No use of buying small devices for extending range that tplink provides just for looks. I have 30 mbps jio fiber connection and haven't been facing any issues with alrdy 6+ devices connected. Looks quite pretty in that white colour. Just loving it.
19186,2,"Routres are supposed to last for years, this one just died in 3, immediately after warranty ended"
19187,5,good more reliable fast and good speed nice n router thank u flipkart.....amazing
19188,5,Good 😘
19189,5,Ok
19190,5,"Good router. Looks sleek and range is pretty decent too. My apartment is over 1200 sq ft. The router is setup in one corner of the house and I receive decent signal at its diagonal opposite end, with 2 walls standing in between. The speed does get a little affected but it's ever so slightly. Nothing major. Good router for home use."
19191,5,Nice product build quality is so good Network of wifi is every where in the house.
19192,2,Worst product.. the radius is not even covering 20metre
19193,5,Nice product
19194,3,I thik it is ok but if you need a range wifi router it is not a very good range router so you can buy another one
19195,1,Worst product I have ever seen it automatically disappeared network issue and I'm having internet connection of 150mbps and this router gives me around 30-40mbps maximum and I'm using it by LAN cable then also I'm having this issue. Please think twice before you buy this product.
19196,5,very nice and best price
19197,5,This is very good and nice speed every one should try
19198,1,"It stops working in between, don't show the range, slow internet speed all this I am saying after using it for 1month."
19199,1,Get disconnected

19234,3,"There are no separate led lan lights for each lan port, there's only one(No router offers them now, Old Versions arent available to purchased ), Setup is not annoying only when connected to laptop or computer, tether app REQUIRES you to sign in. Drops in wifi werent noticed and it does almost reach its advertised speed(tested with 4 devices).

19759,5,Tplink always best and delivery boy was good polite and he delivered on Time
19760,5,Value for money
19761,1,"When the internet goes off, the network indicator light still glows and i feel that the whole purpose is lost. Also the internet disconnects sometimes and restarting the devise brings back the network!! I feel like a faulty piece was delivered to me !!"

19817,5,"I was very skeptical with this purchase. This is my first ever purchase of Wi-Fi Router, as I recently installed broadband connection at my place. Hence, I didn't have much knowledge about this sector. Had to rely totally on Reviews and YouTube Videos. Couldn't find much choice in this range, and I wasn't willing to pay a penny more than 1,300! Well, I don't regret buying this router. Serves its purpose perfectly. I came across with some reviews stating its poor bandwidth. But I'm surprised, ..."

19832,4,Not bad at all. My LAN connection was providing 75-80 MBPS speed while after installing this router speed reduced to 40-45 MBPS. It is looks good..... Range is quite good. From 50 feet it can catch signal even there were 5 wall inbetween.
19833,5,Qrick delivery.Thanks
19834,1,Wifi signal problem.. signal lost after 5/6 hours.. wifi signal back after restart the router... totally manufacturing defect.. big shame by this company...

20311,5,Awesome product. All the antennae working perfectly. I placed the router in my first floor drawing room but I am receiving signal even in my ground floor and my second floor rooms. Totally worth it. So if you are looking for a router with greater coverage area then go for this one.
20312,4,Delivery of flipkart is good. Packing of this product is slightly disapointed. Product quality is fine. But the rang of this router not like 3 antena. Waves of antena cant cross 3 walls beside. The female jacks of this router get some loose with male jack. But the coverage of a 3 floore building is very good. Speed also good. Thank you flipkart for this low price(999).
